Similar schools comparison report

Monitor your school attendance

Autumn term 2025 to 2026 (September to mid-December)

Data protection and data sharing

This report contains sensitive information about your school.

You must store and share the data securely. Read the data protection impact assessment (DPIA) (PDF, 241 KB, 21 pages) for the daily attendance data collection.

Version history

This table shows changes to your summary report for the current academic year.

What is the similar schools comparison report?

This report is a summary of your attendance for pupils in years 1 to 6 compared to 20 similar schools. It’s tailored specifically to your school.

You’ll receive a new report at the end of each half and full term. This helps you build on your progress throughout the year.

We use artificial intelligence, machine learning and expert judgement to highlight where your school is performing well and where there may be opportunities for improvement. This is based on comparisons to similar schools within your geographical region.

Similarities are based on 7 key factors that impact school attendance. These factors include the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM) and those with social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) needs.

You can find full guidance on this report in the user guide, and learn how we calculate and group your similar schools in the methodology paper, available in View your education data (requires login). For some schools, there are small differences between the data in this report and data contained in the Monitor your school attendance service. The user guide includes information about why these differences occur.

Attendance baseline improvement expectation (ABIE)

From the start of the 2026 to 2027 academic year, mainstream schools will receive an ABIE. This is the minimum improvement expected for your school this academic year. Many schools will target and deliver improvements well above their ABIE.

The purpose of the ABIE is to lift the floor on attendance improvement. Schools who meet or exceed it help to sustain the strong rates of attendance improvement made in the 2024 to 2025 academic year.

At the end of the academic year, we’ll compare your school’s attendance outcomes against your ABIE to understand progress and impact.

Your report last half-term included your indicative ABIE for the 2025 to 2026 academic year. Your indicative ABIE has not changed. You should continue to use your attendance improvement ladder to benchmark your current performance against your ABIE, local and national averages, performance of similar schools and pre-pandemic levels of attendance.

What this means for your school

Schools that significantly exceed their ABIE may be contacted by the Department to share their good practice across the sector.

If your school does not meet its ABIE for more than one year or misses it substantially, your school may be offered further support to help get back on track.

Not meeting your ABIE does not lead to formal intervention and Ofsted does not have access to your ABIE.

Named similar schools

This report includes names and Unique Reference Numbers (URN) of the similar schools within your group with higher outcomes for overall and persistent absence. You can search Get information about schools by URN to identify named schools.

You can use this information to contact these schools and compare attendance strategies.

The final page of this report explains how to contact similar schools with higher attendance.

Your indicative ABIE

Your school’s indicative ABIE means your attendance needs to be 0.4 percentage points higher for the 2025 to 2026 academic year than for the 2024 to 2025 academic year, as measured by this report.

This is the minimum improvement you should expect to make this academic year.

If your school meets or exceeds this ABIE, your pupils will gain at least 58 extra school days, compared to last year.

Your ABIE is a starting point, not a limit. We know many schools will target and achieve gains well beyond their ABIE. We encourage you to aim high.

Your school’s attendance for the first half-term may be above your indicative ABIE. ABIEs are minimum expectations for the whole academic year. Attendance typically declines as the year progresses, so early gains are essential to staying on track.

Your school attendance improvement ladder

Your school attendance improvement ladder shows how your school can move beyond your baseline, drawing on your pre-pandemic attendance and the strongest-performing similar schools as useful reference points. It suggests a pathway towards pre-pandemic levels or higher. Each increase brings greater positive impact for your pupils.

Your similar schools comparison

Areas of relative strength

Attendance on Tuesday mornings was 97.5%, higher than 18 out of 20 similar schools.

Year 1 attendance was 97.4%, more than 16 out of 19 similar schools. You also had fewer persistently absent pupils in year 1 than 13 out of 19 similar schools. Some comparisons with similar schools were not possible because that school did not have this year group, or only reported data for a small number of pupils in this year.

Attendance on Wednesday afternoons was 97.3%, higher than 15 out of 20 similar schools.

Areas to focus on

We have identified 3 areas where similar schools have achieved a higher attendance.

If you can match their achievements in these three areas, then your overall attendance rate would increase from 96.3% to 97.9%. This means the proportion of your pupils who are persistently absent would drop from 8% to 8%.

Year 2 attendance was 95.6%, lower than at least a quarter of similar schools. If you increased it to 96.7%, then your overall attendance would go up by 0.6% percentage points. Your overall persistent absence would stay the same.

Attendance of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) support was 92.4%, lower than at least a quarter of similar schools. If you increased it to 95.6%, overall attendance would increase by 0.6%. Your overall persistent absence would stay the same.

Attendance on Fridays was 95.2%, lower than at least a quarter of similar schools. If you increased it to 96.6%, overall attendance would increase by 0.3%%. Your overall persistent absence would stay the same.

Headline figures compared to similar schools

This section shows overall attendance and persistent absence figures for your pupils in years 1 to 6 compared to 20 similar schools.

We calculate results based on data from the start of the 2025 to 2026 academic year up to Monday 22 December 2025.

Overall attendance

Your overall attendance is 96.3% which is 0.2% higher than the median attendance of similar schools. You rank 8th of 21 schools for attendance. This means 13 schools have lower overall attendance than yours.

The 4 schools with the highest overall attendance are:

Goldfield Infants’ and Nursery School (URN 117274)

Harvey Road Primary School (URN 117131)

Kingshill Infant School (URN 117319)

The Russell School (URN 117098)

Persistent absence

Your persistent absence is 8% which is 0.6% lower than the median attendance of similar schools. You rank 9th of 21 schools for persistent absence. This means 12 similar schools have a higher rate of persistent absence than your school.

The 4 schools with the lowest persistent absence are:

Broxbourne CofE Primary School (URN 117437)

Goldfield Infants’ and Nursery School (URN 117274)

Pupil group comparison

We are unable to calculate attendance for some pupil groups.

This could be due to:

missing or unavailable data in your management information system (MIS)

a small number of pupils in this group in the current academic year.

Contacting similar schools with higher attendance

Contacting similar schools with higher attendance may provide you with further sources of support. You should read the DfE guidance on improving attendance before contacting other schools. Guidance includes:

Working together to improve school attendance - provides statutory guidance for schools, trusts and local authorities, and outlines effective strategies for improving attendance.

Summary table of responsibilities for school attendance - gives a concise overview of attendance roles and responsibilities across the system.

Attendance Toolkit - shares approaches, case studies and resources from system leaders to help schools improve attendance.

Toolkit for schools: communicating with families to support attendance - offers practical examples and insights to help schools talk with families about attendance.

Finding contact details

You can find contact details for similar schools with higher attendance within your group using:

Get information about schools - search by school name or URN to find names of school leaders, associated trusts, and links to school websites.

School websites - most schools publish contact details and leadership team information. Use enquiry forms or the contact details of attendance leads where available.

When contacting schools, you may wish to ask them about:

Data and targeted support: how to gather, share and use attendance data to put in place action to improve attendance.

Culture: how to embed a support-first culture to encourage high attendance and make school a place children want to attend.

People: how to make attendance ‘everyone’s business’ and ensure individuals and teams work together to reduce absence.

Processes and systems: how to develop and implement strong and rigorous processes to identify and respond quickly and effectively to absence.

Relationships: how to build strong and positive relationships with pupils and families to understand, then prevent or remove barriers to attendance.

Communications: how to develop and share strong and inclusive attendance communications that convey messages with impact.

Transition: how to ensure new pupils joining your school feel they belong at school and are clear on expectations around attendance.

The school does not give the weakest readers the support they need. Pupils read books that do not match precisely enough the sounds they know. This means that pupils do not learn quickly to read with fluency. The school needs to review the support given to early readers, and ensure that this is provided effectively, so that the weakest readers remember their sounds better and can use these to build up their skills and confidence in reading. | The school does not give the weakest readers the support they need.

The school does not use assessment as effectively as it could to check and ensure that pupils remember what they have learned in the longer term. As a result, some pupils lack the sticky knowledge they need to build up a detailed understanding of their subjects. The school needs to ensure it uses the information from checks on learning, both in lessons and at the end of units of learning, to adapt the next curriculum delivery effectively This will enable pupils to remember more of what they learn in the longer term. | The school does not use assessment as effectively as it could to check and ensure that pupils remember what they have learned in the longer term.

School Context Overview 
Whole School Context
Victoria C of E Infant and Nursery School is a small infant school within the Castle Federation, working closely with Thomas Coram to ensure curriculum consistency, shared values and high expectations for all pupils across the federation. The school serves Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 pupils. Leadership is strong, with the Head of School appointed in September 2022 and the Executive Headteacher in January 2024. The school has a strong safeguarding culture, effective governance and a clear vision centered on inclusion, equity and strong foundations for learning. Outcomes in phonics, EYFS and KS1 are consistently above national and Hertfordshire averages, with reading a clear strength following rapid and decisive improvement actions.
The school community includes pupils with a wide range of needs, including SEND, pupils eligible for Pupil Premium and children with emerging speech, language and communication needs. Attendance and behaviour are strong, supported by clear systems, rigorous monitoring and close partnership with families. Staff professional development is prioritised to ensure consistent, high-quality provision.
Class-Level Context
Classes are inclusive, adaptive and focuses on quality first teaching, with teaching structured around a clearly sequenced and well-designed curriculum. Teachers use regular formative assessment to identify gaps in learning and adapt teaching accordingly. Reading, oracy and foundational skills in English and maths are prioritised in all classes. Adults are deployed strategically to support learning, particularly for vulnerable pupils, while maintaining high expectations for all. Classroom environments are calm, purposeful and adapted to support regulation, independence and engagement.
Group Context (e.g. SEND, Pupil Premium, EAL, Vulnerable Pupils)
The school adopts an equity-based approach to meeting the needs of groups of pupils. Pupils with SEND and those eligible for Pupil Premium are identified early and supported through high-quality teaching, targeted interventions and personalised adaptations. The HFL Every Child (VIP) programme ensures that pupils with potential barriers to learning have a named champion, with progress, attendance and wellbeing closely tracked. Small-group and ‘keep up’ interventions, particularly in phonics and early reading, are used to prevent pupils from falling behind. Attendance and engagement of vulnerable groups are monitored rigorously, with strong parental partnership and external agency support where needed.
Individual Pupil Context
Every pupil is known well by staff. Individual strengths, needs and barriers to learning are identified through baseline assessments, ongoing formative assessment and regular pupil progress meetings. Support plans, adaptations and interventions are tailored to the individual and reviewed regularly for impact. For pupils with complex additional needs, early identification, personalised provision and close collaboration with parents and external professionals ensure timely and effective support. Pupil voice is valued, and children are supported to develop confidence, resilience and a strong sense of belonging within the school community.
This contextual overview underpins teaching, assessment, inclusion and pastoral support across the school, ensuring that all pupils are supported to flourish academically, socially and emotionally.

Teachers use regular formative assessment to identify gaps in learning and adapt teaching accordingly. Reading, oracy and foundational skills in English and maths are prioritised in all classes. Adults are deployed strategically to support learning, particularly for vulnerable pupils, while maintaining high expectations for all. Classroom environments are calm, purposeful and adapted to support regulation, independence and engagement.
Group Context (e.g. SEND, Pupil Premium, EAL, Vulnerable Pupils)
The school adopts an equity-based approach to meeting the needs of groups of pupils. Pupils with SEND and those eligible for Pupil Premium are identified early and supported through high-quality teaching, targeted interventions and personalised adaptations. The HFL Every Child (VIP) programme ensures that pupils with potential barriers to learning have a named champion, with progress, attendance and wellbeing closely tracked. Small-group and ‘keep up’ interventions, particularly in phonics and early reading, are used to prevent pupils from falling behind. Attendance and engagement of vulnerable groups are monitored rigorously, with strong parental partnership and external agency support where needed.
Individual Pupil Context
Every pupil is known well by staff. Individual strengths, needs and barriers to learning are identified through baseline assessments, ongoing formative assessment and regular pupil progress meetings. Support plans, adaptations and interventions are tailored to the individual and reviewed regularly for impact. For pupils with complex additional needs, early identification, personalised provision and close collaboration with parents and external professionals ensure timely and effective support. Pupil voice is valued, and children are supported to develop confidence, resilience and a strong sense of belonging within the school community.

The Castle Federation 5-Year Strategic Plan

2024-2028

What are the federation’s vision and values? 

Our Federation vision: 

“Flourishing in learning and love.”

‘Do everything in love.’  (1 Corinthians 16:14)

We have four core values at the heart of all we do. These values have been generated through our stakeholder consultation and apply equally to the whole community of schools in the Federation. The four values are: 

Kindness 

Respect 

Resilience  

Thankfulness 

What is the context for this plan? 

As part of our stakeholder consultation, Jan-July 2024, we asked all our parents, staff, pupils, governors and key members of our school community, what we did well and what we could do better. This provided us with valuable information regarding the advantages and challenges of living in our community and the challenges we feel our children face. 

Young people starting work in the next decade will work longer, change jobs more often and compete against a highly qualified international market. As well as the appropriate qualifications to compete successfully in an increasingly uncertain jobs market, young people need flexibility, creativity and transferable lifelong learning skills. 

The children leaving Year 6 this year will be young adults in 2031 and the world will look very different by then. We have used the OECD report entitled “The future of Education and Skills 2030’ to identify how our strategic plan can prepare our children for jobs that have not yet been created, for technologies that have not yet been invented, to solve problems that have not yet been anticipated. The report identifies the following key points: 

As computer technologies have displaced labour in routine tasks, they have also created new employment opportunities for workers with non-routine cognitive skills, such as creativity, and social and emotional skills. 

To remain competitive, workers will need to acquire new skills continually, which requires flexibility, a positive attitude towards lifelong learning and curiosity. 

Social and emotional skills can be equally – and in some cases even more – as important as cognitive skills in becoming a responsible citizen. 

Social and emotional skills, such as empathy, self-awareness, respect for others and the ability to communicate, are becoming essential as classrooms and workplaces become more ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse.  

Achievement at school also depends on a number of social and emotional skills, such as perseverance, efficacy, responsibility, curiosity and emotional stability. Physical and practical skills are not only associated with daily manual tasks, such as feeding and clothing oneself, but also with the arts.  

Our strategic plan aims to enable children to be well-prepared for the future and to give them the skills they will need to thrive as adults.  

Our Strategic Plan Priorities  

Educational excellence

Safeguarding - to create a culture of safeguarding where rigorous vigilance underpins everything we do

Pupil outcomes – progress and attainment, all pupils working at or above age related expectations 

Curriculum 

Progressive and sequential 

Curriculum enrichment through trips, experiences and extra-curricular activities accessible for all 

Accessibility for all through highly effective adaptation 

Equity, diversity and inclusion 

Career programme 

Religious education and collective worship – as Church schools these elements are fundamental

Monitoring and accountability – leaders monitor the quality of teaching and implementation of the curriculum where all staff are supported to develop professionally.  

Happiness

Mental health agenda – mental health leads to ensure that this agenda is always at the forefront of support and 

Pupil well-being – ongoing and annual pupil voice 

Staff well-being – staff voice, appraisals, well-being charter 

Values and vision in action underpin everything 

Pupil responsibilities and character development 

Community

 Relationships with the local Churches, the Church of England and the Diocese 

Promotion of activities and raise awareness of issues the local, national and global communities face

Cultural capital - skills, knowledge and experiences that individuals acquire through their cultural background and upbringing  

Relationships with parents - work in partnership/ effective communication 

Local schools - work with the local HT consortium, HT at Swing Gate / Ashlyns 

Sustainability 

Finance – to ensure highly effective management of the finances to maximise pupil’s educational experiences within a framework of prudence and future planning. Taking into account external and internal environment factors. Maximise capacity for generating income. 

Staff recruitment and retention – high quality CPD, supportive appraisal processes, an environment where staff can flourish and work collaboratively

Premises – the buildings are safe, well, maintained, support learning and promote an attractive learning environment

Digital strategy – to provide a technically advanced learning environment with very strong infrastructure that is progressive, prepares pupils for the next stage of their education. Software and hardware that is renewed on a rolling programme so staff can work efficiently, and pupils’ access a high-quality curriculum. 

Environmental sustainability – pupils to be aware of the challenges faced on the planet and be proactive in addressing how we can help, locally and globally. 

Our vision and values are central to our strategic plan and underpin all aspects of school life.

Part A: Pupil premium strategy plan
Statement of intent
At the heart of our pupil premium strategy lies a powerful belief: every child possesses
a diamond of potential, waiting to shine. We are resolute in our mission to ensure that
no child’s brilliance is dulled by disadvantage. It is our duty—and our privilege—to
uncover, nurture, and amplify that potential so every learner thrives both in school and
in life. Staff identify every pupil that has a vulnerability/possible barrier to learning,
allocating them an adult champion, as part of the local authority, Every Child Program.
We are not just investing funding; we are investing hope, ambition, and relentless
determination. Through strategic and purposeful use of our pupil premium grant, we will
ignite opportunity, dismantle barriers, and elevate outcomes for all, especially those
who need us most, ‘you let them off, you let them down’.
Our strategy is built on these objectives for transformation. We strategically plan
spending of the PPG to meet these objectives by allocating funds to:
• Further develop high quality first teaching, assessment and effective learning
strategies using research-based evidence which responds to the needs of the
individual
• Support social, emotional and behavioural needs, giving children the confidence
and resilience to support independent learning
• To improve communication, attendance and parental partnership, as this
consistently increases academic outcomes.
• Intervene swiftly, with a targeted approach at the point a specific need is identified
• Adopt a whole school approach in which all staff take responsibility for vulnerable
pupils’ outcomes and raise expectations of what they can achieve
• To create a sense of belonging where all children flourish, are valued, feel safe,
supported and included
We will champion an equity approach for our most vulnerable children where we
celebrate excellence, and never stop striving until every child, regardless of background,
is given the chance to succeed.
Challenges
This details the key challenges to achievement that we are determined to overcome. We
are unwavering in our commitment to ensuring that every child—regardless of
background—can thrive and flourish. Our assessments, observations, and reflections
have helped us identify four critical challenges that we are determined to tackle head-on:

Challenge | Detail of challenge

number

1 | Attendance and engagement in learning: Learning can only happen when children
are present and engaged. We are concerned that some pupils are missing too much
school or are not fully engaged when they are here. We will work closely with families

and staff to improve attendance and foster a culture of curiosity, motivation, and active
learning.
2 To develop a sense of belonging where every child can flourish, achieve and
thrive: School to strengthen opportunities to develop background knowledge and
cultural capital experiences from an equity perspective. Every child will have a
champion who will be an advocate for that child. The champion will create a sense of
belonging by noticing, listening and supporting their child. Through a collective effort,
children will rise to the higher, consistent expectations to improve their academic and
wellbeing outcomes. This will also develop self-esteem and resilience to support
independent learning.
3 To ensure the strong foundations are in place for reading, writing and maths so
basic skills are automatic: We will confront these challenges with targeted, high-
quality support to unlock every child’s ability to be confident in reading, writing and
maths. This helps free up space for children to develop new skills and learning. By
focusing on phonics, handwriting, number fluency, spelling and sentence construction,
gaps in attainment will become smaller between most vulnerable children and their
peers.
4 Additional learning needs impacting core subjects: For some pupils, additional
learning needs are slowing progress in reading, writing and maths. We are committed
to identifying these needs with precision and providing tailored support and
interventions that accelerate progress and build lasting confidence. Baseline
assessments at the start of each academic year are often lower than peers, including
lower starting points when joining the school. Without targeted support theses gaps in
attainment could become larger over time.

Part B: Review of outcomes in the previous academic
year
Pupil premium strategy outcomes
This details the impact that our pupil premium activity had on pupils in the 2024 to 2025
academic year.
Challenge 1: Work in partnership with families to improve attendance/punctuality to be
at or above average.
Listening to the views of parents and understanding the underlying issues, we have worked
with families to improve attendance. This has included fully funded places at Breakfast Club,
earlier drop off time to help the child settle into the day before the other children are in and
working with a group of external providers through a project called Solution Circles, where
different providers offer advice and support to the family.
Attendance figures for 2024/2025:
PPG Non-PPG
Attendance 93% (increase of 9% from 96%
Sept 24 to July 25)
Challenge 2: School to strengthen opportunities to develop background knowledge and
cultural capital experiences from an equity perspective.
PPG children have funding to attend clubs through the Sports Premium/PPG fund. Pupil voice
is gathered annually from the PPG children to see which clubs they enjoy attending and to
discuss the clubs on offer. These range from yoga, dance, art, drama and sporting clubs.
External visits to the school for example authors and an illustrator enhance the love of reading.
PPG children were given a copy of the books. PPG children get free places to PTA events and
families are contacted by the office in advance to remind them of the events taking place and to
see if their child would like to attend. The school also funds all external trips for PPG children
Challenge 3: Baseline assessments at the start of the academic year lower than peers,
including lower starting points when joining the school. Without targeted support these
gaps in attainment could become larger over time.
Results from 2024/25 Statutory Assessments
Non-PPG % PPG % Victoria PPG % National
EYFS GLD 81 0 (2 pupils) 51.3
Phonic Screening 86.7 50 (2 pupils) 67
Context
EYFS- 1 child had EHCP and went to specialist provision after Reception and 1 child joined us
at the end of May 2025. Both are SEND
PSC-1 child had an EHCP and both are SEND.
Termly Pupil Progress Meetings identify the impact of progress termly. PPG children have
made better progress in reading since the introduction of Little Wandle phonics. Maths and
writing still need to be more targeted with resources and scaffolding available, progress has
been made in these subjects, but they have not met expectations in their year groups.
Challenge 4: To develop self-esteem/resilience to support independent learning.
Using PSHE Association and 3D PSHE, all children are taught about relationships, overcoming
barriers and where to ask for help and support. During lessons, PPG children are supported
through QFT, scaffolding and questioning to enable them to become independent learners.
CPD for staff has been around QFT including Rosenshine’s Principles of Instruction on how to

enable learners to be successful including breaking tasks into small steps, retrieval practice
and questioning. This has improved resilience in the classroom when approaching new and
unfamiliar tasks. It has also enabled PPG to make small steps of progress from their baseline
starting points.
There has also been staff training on adaptative teaching, where staff have identified specific
barriers to access the learning and put in place adaptations to support success.
Every class has a provision map for all staff to access which highlights the barriers to learning
and support to enable PPG children to access the curriculum successfully.
All KS1 classes use of the Zones of Regulation to enable children to be aware of their feelings
and how to manage them. (EYFS use a ‘emotions’ wall)
Challenge 5: Some pupils have special educational needs, in addition to being pupil
premium.
Nationally, 25.7% of children are eligible for FSM.22 However, this figure is 39.3% for those
categorised as receiving SEND support and 43.8% for those in receipt of EHCPs.23 While
overall children eligible for FSM are over-represented in the SEND cohort-Sutton Trust Report
2025
Early identification through baseline assessment and pupil progress information, enables staff
to pinpoint specific barriers to accessing core subjects. Since introducing Little Wandle, 1 child
has been making significant progress in their reading by following the SEND pathway, reducing
cognitive overload by simplifying the lesson structure. This is delivered 1:1. Another child has
been supported externally by a group of professionals through a program called ‘Solution
Circles’. This has all the different providers working together to improve attendance because of
arriving late to school. Since starting this, the child has been arriving at school most days just
after school starts, so has been present for the maths and English lessons. This has decreased
the attainment gap between non-FSM/SEND children.
By working closely with families, we have improved attendance, helped secure a place in a
special school for 1 child and narrowed the gaps in learning for core subjects.
We have reviewed our strategy plan and made changes to how we intend to use some of
the budget this academic year.

It is designed to be used alongside our school inspection toolkit , to guide inspectors’ conversations with school leaders. It is not meant to provide a complete picture of a school or any judgement or assessment of a school. The IDSR might contain sensitive information about schools and colleges. It is your responsibility to make sure you store and share the IDSR securely. Please see the IDSR conditions of use and storage statement in our guidance (linked at the top of the IDSR). Data is presented in the IDSR based on the URN to which it is assigned. Where a school’s URN has changed within the timeframes represented in the IDSR, data will be displayed in different reports.

For a school that has a sixth form, an additional row will show information relating to Years 12, 13 and, where applicable, 14. For each measure, text and shading are used to show where the school sits within the national distribution of all schools, or to show the banding of the local area average within the national distribution of all schools. The local averages are based on the DfE spring census of pupils at schools in the same phase. Local area averages are not shown for the school number on roll, location deprivation or stability measures. Local area is based on the middle-layer super output area (MSOA) in which the school resides. MSOAs comprise between 2,000 and 6,000 households and have a resident population of, generally, between 5,000 and 15,000 people. MSOAs fit within local authorities. The MSOA used in the IDSR for each school will be displayed at the top of this section. For more information about MSOAs, visit the Office for National Statistics website . The possible National distribution bandings in this section are: Well above average (blue shading) Above average Close to average Below average Well below average (orange shading) The banding shows how the school or local average figure compares with the national figure. If the value is more than 0.5 standard deviations (SDs) above the national rate, it is classed as ‘Above average’. If it is more than 0.5 SDs below the national rate, it is classed as ‘Below average’. If it is more than one SD above the national rate, it is classed as ‘Well above average’ and highlighted in blue. If it is more than one SD below the national rate, it is classed as ‘Well below average’ and highlighted in orange. Otherwise, it is ‘Close to average’ and shown in grey. Except for the school location deprivation measure, schools are compared with other schools in the same phase: primary (including middle deemed primary) or secondary (including middle deemed secondary, and all-through schools). Special schools are compared with the national distribution for secondary schools. FSM6 in this chart refers to the percentage of pupils who are or have been eligible for free school meals and have claimed them during Reception to Year 11 sometime in the last 6 years. Stability is a measure of the percentage of students who were admitted to the school at the standard time of admission. The stability percentage is calculated by dividing the number of pupils who meet the stability criteria by the number of all eligible pupils (pupils in Years 1 to 11 with a single or main dual registration at the school at the time of the January school census). The stability measure is not available for school sixth forms. Information regarding the level of deprivation in the school’s location is provided, along with aggregated pupil-derived deprivation indicators at school, sixth form (where applicable) and local area level. Each deprivation indicator is based on the English indices of deprivation from 2025. You can read further information about the data used for the local area deprivation . For deprivation measures, ‘Above average’ means “more deprived” and ‘Below average’ means “less deprived”. There is additional guidance about this section.

The 2 halves of the table represent pupils who have SEN support and pupils who have an education, health and care (EHC) plan. No highlighting is applied to this table; figures are presented purely for information. The text above the table displays if the school has any resourced provision. This could be a SEN unit, resourced provision or both. The capacity represents how many pupils the provision displayed can accommodate. The type of SEN provision lists, where applicable, the type of SEN that is provided for. This section also displays how many pupils with SEN have received free school meals at any time during the last 6 years and/or who are looked-after children (in the care of the local authority for a day or more or who have been adopted from care).

The table presents data for pupils who were recorded as part of the previous January school census. As such, the data presented against each year group is about the cohort that was in that year group in the last academic year. For example, the data in the Year 7 column is about the cohort who were in Year 7 in the previous academic year, not the cohort who are in Year 7 in the current academic year. The measures included in the table are: the number of pupils on roll the percentage of pupils in receipt of free school meals (FSM) at the time of the census; these pupils are those who are or have been eligible for FSM and have claimed them, during Reception to Year 11, sometime in the last 6 years (FSM data is not collected for sixth forms) the percentage of pupils whose first language is not English or is believed to be other than English the number of pupils identified as young carers the number of pupils who are children in need, including children on child protection plans and looked-after children – this includes children who have child-in-need plans and other types of plans or arrangements, and children waiting for a referral to be considered, an assessment to start, or an assessment that has started to be completed; these are pupils who were a child in need at any point during the reporting year (1 April to 31 March inclusive) the number of looked-after children – these are pupils who are looked after for at least one day during the year and are aged 4 to 15 at 31 August; this excludes looked-after children under an agreed series of short placements and those who were on remand/committed for trial or sentence and accommodated by the local authority No highlighting is applied to this table; figures are presented for information only.

The areas covered are: the proportion of education support staff relative to teaching staff teacher absence staff retention Information on staff turnover is calculated using the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) turnover leavers and the total FTE staff at the school. A school is considered to have high staff turnover if its turnover rate was in the highest 20% in any of the previous 3 years. Low staff turnover is not highlighted. Special schools are compared with primaries. Turnover and leavers at a school level can be very volatile from year to year. When looking at rates of leavers and turnover, it is important to consider school size, because this has a particularly big impact on turnover rates for small schools. There is additional guidance about this section. There is nothing to highlight for the proportion of education support staff relative to teaching staff in 2024. There is nothing to highlight for teachers with at least one period of sickness absence. There is nothing to highlight for days lost to teacher absence (6 days) in 2023/24. At the time of the November 2024 census, there were no full-time vacant teacher posts in the school. Staff turnover was in the highest 20% in: 2023, 2022, 2021. Back to contents Attendance and behaviour Attendance and persistent absence Data source: the DfE’s 2024/25 (2 term), 2023/24 (3 term), 2022/23 (3 term) and 2018/19 (3 term) academic year data Guidance This section contains tables and charts for overall attendance and persistent absence, which provide data for the school and a comparison with the national average. To compare the school value with the national average, we have calculated standard deviations (SDs) and confidence intervals (CIs). CIs are used for persistent absence only. Each set of tables and charts is available for 3 different pupil groups: all pupils enrolled at the school free school meals (FSM) pupils: those who have been eligible for FSM at any time during the last 6 years – referred to as FSM6 pupils who have a statement of special educational needs (SEN) or an education, health and care (EHC) plan, or who receive SEN support but do not have an EHC plan This section includes data for 2018/19 because, nationally, attendance declined sharply in 2020/21 during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not recovered. Inclusion of 2018/19 data will show whether the school has managed to return to pre-pandemic attendance levels. Overall attendance is calculated as: 100 – ((number of absence sessions / number of sessions it was possible to attend) * 100). Absence is the total of all authorised and unauthorised absences. Schools are compared with other schools in the same phase of education: primary (including middle deemed primary) or secondary (including middle deemed secondary and all-through schools). Special schools are compared against the national distribution for secondary schools. The national distribution banding shows how the school’s rate compares with the national rate. For overall attendance, if the school’s rate is more than 0.5 SDs above the national rate, it is classed as ‘Above’ and highlighted in green. If the school’s rate is more than 0.5 SDs below the national rate, it is classed as ‘Below’ and highlighted in red. Otherwise it is ‘Close to average’ and shown in grey. Due to the methodology used to calculate overall attendance, this banding does not indicate statistical significance. For persistent absence it is calculated differently, as it uses both the SD and a CI to indicate whether the school’s persistent absence rate is, statistically, significantly above or below the national average. School values that are more than 0.5 SDs above the national rate and significantly above average – Above (sig+) – are highlighted red. School values that are more than 0.5 SDs below the national rate and significantly below average – Below (sig-) – are highlighted green. All other values are shown in grey. Overall attendance trend shows whether the school trend is in line with the national trend, or if the school’s attendance has improved or declined relative to the national change. Persistent absence trend indicates whether there has been a statistically significant increase or decrease in the school’s persistent absence rate in a particular year, compared with the previous year. The year 3 rate is compared with 2018/19 to illustrate how persistent absence has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. The school context column indicates whether the whole school has a higher-than-average proportion of students who have been eligible for FSM at any time during the last 6 years (FSM6), or a higher-than-average proportion of pupils who receive SEN support, or who have a statement of SEN or an EHC plan. There is additional guidance about this section. Key to charts Attendance Persistent absence Attendance The trend analysis for the Attendance measure is different to the trend analysis elsewhere in the IDSR. For Attendance, our trend analysis compares the school trend with the national trend and determines whether it is in line with it or whether the school trend is showing either relative improvement or relative decline.

These provide data for the school and a comparison with the national average. The number and proportion of pupils who have had suspensions or permanent exclusions in a school are often very small, especially in primary schools. These figures should be interpreted with caution, particularly when making comparisons over time. The suspensions and permanent exclusions data is one year behind and therefore may not relate to the same cohort as other IDSR data. The whole school measure includes all year groups in the school. This section contains tables and charts displaying information about pupils who have had one or more suspensions and pupils who have had two or more suspensions, for the most recent 3 years for which data is available. Each set of tables and charts is available for 3 different pupil groups: all pupils enrolled at the school free school meals (FSM) pupils: those who have been eligible for FSM at any time during the last 6 years – referred to as FSM6 pupils who have a statement of special educational needs (SEN) or an education, health and care (EHC) plan, or who receive SEN support but do not have an EHC plan To compare the school’s data with the national average, we have calculated standard deviations (SDs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Schools are compared with other schools in the same phase of education: primary (including middle deemed primary) or secondary (including middle deemed secondary and all-through schools). Special schools are compared against the national distribution for secondary schools. The national distribution banding shows how the school’s rate compares with the national rate. This comparison uses both the SD and a CI to indicate whether the school’s suspension rate is, statistically, significantly above or below the national average. School values that are more than 0.5 SDs above the national rate and significantly above average – Above (sig+) – are highlighted red. School values that are more than 0.5 SDs below the national rate and significantly below average – Below (sig-) – are highlighted green. All other values are shown in grey. Trend indicates whether there has been a statistically significant increase or decrease in the school’s suspension rate in a particular year, compared with the previous year. The school context column indicates whether the whole school has a higher-than-average proportion of students who have been eligible for FSM at any time during the last 6 years (FSM6), or a higher-than-average proportion of pupils who receive SEN support, or who have a statement of SEN or an EHC plan. Suspension rate data is positively skewed, especially for primary schools, because many schools have a very low suspension rate. However, a small number of schools have a higher rate, so there is a long above-the-national-average section, but only approximately a quarter of schools fall into this band. Some of these high rates may be due to errors in the source data. Reasons for suspensions and permanent exclusions are for the most recent year and they will only be displayed if there has been at least 1 suspension or permanent exclusion in the most recent year. Up to 3 reasons can be recorded. These reasons are recorded without weighting or prioritisation. Therefore, the total number of reasons may exceed the total number of suspensions or permanent exclusions. There is additional guidance about this section.

To compare the school value with the national average, we have calculated standard deviations (SDs) and confidence intervals. Data is presented for the most recent 3 years and is provided for all pupils only. We have averaged school and national results across data years to produce a 3-year average. This helps us smooth out year-to-year fluctuations in the data so we can spot genuine trends and significant patterns that might otherwise be hidden. This is particularly important in small schools, where a single pupil’s outcome can disproportionately affect the data. A school’s position on the national distribution is determined using SDs. ‘Above’ indicates when a school’s value is more than 0.5 SDs above the national value. ‘Below’ indicates when a school’s value is more than 0.5 SDs below the national value. All other school values are ‘Close to average’. Combining the school value’s position within the national distribution and a measure of statistical confidence in the school value, there are 7 possible interpretations of school performance (the national distribution banding). These are: Above (sig+) Above (non-sig) Close to average (sig+) Close to average (non-sig) Close to average (sig-) Below (non-sig) Below (sig-) When school values fall into the ‘Close to average’ banding, or they are not, statistically, significantly different from national (non-sig), the national distribution banding will be coloured grey. When school values fall into the ‘Above’ banding and are, statistically, significantly above the national value, it will be highlighted in green. When school values fall into the ‘Below’ banding and are, statistically, significantly below the national value, it will be highlighted in red. Trend shows whether there has been a statistically significant increase or decrease in the school’s value in a particular year, compared with the previous year. Trends are not available for the furthest year, as no comparator year is displayed. The year group context column indicates whether the relevant year group has a high proportion of pupils who are or have been eligible for free school meals (FSM) and have claimed them at some time in the last 6 years (FSM6), or have high special educational needs (SEN) or low stability. The phonics measure uses Year 1 cohort characteristics. The sentences show: the total number of pupils who were eligible to be screened for phonics the number of pupils who sat the check, and who did not, where applicable the number of pupils who did not meet the expected standard, where applicable the average mark for pupils who did not meet the expected standard (where the number not meeting the standard was greater than 5) The number of pupils who did not sit the phonics screening check includes (where applicable): the number who were absent, the number who were disapplied, and the number for whom there was maladministration. There is additional guidance about this section. Key to charts All pupils - Phonics expected standard There were 45 pupils who were eligible for the phonics screening check in Year 1 in 2025; 41 of them sat the check and 4 did not. Of those who sat the check, 2 pupils did not meet the phonics expected standard . There were 3 pupils who were eligible for the phonics screening check in Year 2 in 2025; all of them sat the check.

This is to allow inspectors to be able to contextualise the information they gather on inspection. EYFSP data is no longer externally moderated by local authorities, therefore should be treated with caution. Conclusions based solely on this data should be avoided and instead be used in conjunction with on site evidence and conversations.

Monitoring reports
Rationales for spending decisions
SFVS
Resources committee
The school is in a healthy financial position due to effective financial management and have a health
carry forward to weather the low birth rate pupil numbers
Spending decisions have been to improve pupil outcomes, CPD, effective curriculum resources and maintanance of the environment
Actions from the previous Ofsted:
The school does not give the
weakest readers the support they need. Pupils read
books that do not match precisely enough the sounds they know. This means that
pupils do not learn quickly to read with fluency. The school needs to review the
support given to early readers, and ensure that this is provided effectively, so that
the weakest readers remember their sounds better and can use these to build up
their skills and confidence in reading.
New phonics scheme – Little Wandle
2024 phonics screening check data 91% (national 80.3% /
Herts 81.3%)
External validation of impact – SEA visit / CSV visit
Forensic assessment / intervention / progress
The school does not use assessment as effectively as it could to check and ensure
that pupils remember what they have learned in the longer term. As a result,
some pupils lack the sticky knowledge they need to build up a detailed
understanding of their subjects. The school needs to ensure it uses the
information from checks on learning, both in lessons and at the end of units of
learning, to adapt the next curriculum delivery effectively. This will enable pupils

Deep dive methodologies
Recapping/ revisiting
Discussed at P&C 4/6/25
Pupil voices to check information is retained
Knowledge organisers
Not all staff know how to support pupils well, whether within lessons or outside.
They are not all clear on how to stop pupils falling behind, or how to successfully
support those who do. This is both in early reading and in some foundation
subjects. The school needs to ensure that all staff get the training and monitoring
they need to be able to support pupils effectively with their learning, so that the
implementation of the curriculum is more consistently effective.
CPD
Improvement plans
HR consultation
ECT mentoring
Boosting/ interventions
Safeguarding – created a culture of safeguarding where everyone is vigilant and everyone is responsible
Culture of vigilance
– deeply rooted and constantly revisited the welfare of
pupils is always the priority
CPD
– safeguarding
Prevent training
– radicalisation and extremism
Incels
-
“involuntary celibates "online subculture of predominately young, heterosexual men who believe they are unable to establish relationships. These self-proclaimed incels tend to blame society – and women in particular – for their lack of sexual or romantic experiences. Andrew Tate culture
County lines
- County lines is a form of criminal exploitation. It is when criminals befriend children, either online of offline, and then manipulate them into drug dealing. The 'lines' refer to mobile phones that are used to control a young person who is delivering drugs, often to towns outside their home county.
Safer recruitment processes
– adverts/ shortlisting/social media checks/ references/application forms/ interview questions / references / gaps in timelines 
CPOMS
(online recording system for all staff) 
- recording / following up / 
every case or entry is monitored by another DSL and DDSL . Rigorous in record keeping and tenacious in following up concerns.
SINGLE CENTRAL RECORD
- is a mandatory document that educational establishments in the UK must maintain. It is a centralised record of all the pre-employment checks conducted on staff, including teachers, support staff and volunteers, to ensure they are suitable for working with children. The SCR is a legal requirement and a critical component of OFSTED/ISI inspections. During an inspection, the OFSTED/ISI Inspector will ask to view the record.

The wider opportunities showcased and the response of the children through discussions demonstrate that they are very well prepared for the next stage in learning.  
The youngest children are well supported in learning environments with a range of thoughtful provocations to promote their interest and curiosity.  
Social skills were observed to be developed at such a young age.  They communicate their needs and wants clearly and have learnt routines and behaviours that support their emotional regulation.  
The aims in early years provision is to develop the characteristics of effective learning which include exploring, playing, concentrating, connecting, problem solving, experimenting and enjoying their activities – this was clearly in evidence. 
Staff model activities, expectations and behaviours well and empower the children, encouraging them to talk about their learning. 
Children are supported well to name their feelings which provides them with the vocabulary to support in conflict resolution.  
Independent learning strategies are highlighted along with the class agreement about rules and expectations – all strong examples of high-quality personal development. | Embed baseline/exit activities in all PSHE lessons

Reading 
L Freeman
SEA Visit
English Hub Half Termly | Reviewed assessment data for PPAMS and shared information at parent consultations. 
Website up to date, including links to Little Wandle, reading curriculum and tips for parents
Workshops for Little Wandle and PSC have been held for parents to support children at home, as well as understanding how we deliver the scheme.
Identified trends and gaps for addition phonic lessons in YR1 and repeated practice for blending in R.
YR2 children who have not completed the LW program continue with reading groups and rapid catch up. 
Regular assessments show children who need to Keep up are closing the gaps with the additional support.
Assessment
PSC- Predicted 86% YR1 and 100% YR2 retakes.
YR2 Assessment- 80% predicted to be expected or above 
All YR2 children have completed the Little Wandle program by Spring 2025.
Half termly assessment (every 3 weeks for children who are not on track) feeds into revisit lessons before moving onto new content and enables targeted support.
English Hub and SEA both reported the forensic and detailed approach to assessment to ensure gaps were filled and children developing fluency through targeted interventions.
SEA Visit
Exemplary progress is observed to have been made in response to this OFSTED key point for action.  The leaders and staff term deserve recognition for their commitment and determination to demonstrate high quality standards in this critical area of learning.  This visit demonstrated: 
Reading has been the highest priority.  Embracing the guidance from The English Hub has made the difference. 
There is an urgent, responsive approach if pupils start to fall behind in their phonic acquisition.  This is supported through the capacity, skilled and timely use of the Little Wandle tracking system.  
The weakest readers get effective support. This has been observed through the skilled delivery of the SEND programme with staff who have been trained comprehensively to deliver this to a high standard. 
Pupils read books that match the sounds they know. This means that pupils are learning to read quickly with fluency.
Reading for Pleasure 
Reading for pleasure is promoted through daily reading to class, author visits, weekly timetabled library sessions, range of genres of books in classrooms. 
Specialist reading weeks/days (World Book Day) focused on reading your own way, engaging children to read more and sharing their reading journey.
Connection with the local library through visits (EYFS) and reading challenges increased reading for pleasure.
Books are available at lunchtimes through our Little outdoor Library and at ASC. | SEA Recommendations
Further develop the role of the teaching assistants in relation to supporting learning development to ensure consistency of approach across all classrooms.  You have strong practitioners for are valuable assets to the school.  Aim for consistency in approach for the maximum impact on learning. 
Continue to develop parental engagement in the learning process for phonics and early reading.  You have many families who will want to engage and support their child’s learning and this is a further asset for the school.
English Hub support will continue with Little Wandle after ‘graduating’. This will ensure monitoring of consistency, updates and training to deliver Little Wandle.
Regular coaching/training sessions for staff to deliver best phonic lessons

Demonstrating wellbeing support in school

At Victoria, wellbeing is a key priority embedded across all aspects of our culture.  We foster a supportive and inclusive environment where staff and pupils feel safe, valued, and heard.

Emotional wellbeing is promoted through open dialogue, consistent relationship building and a strong pastoral support.

We provide safe accessible spaces, and encourage regular checking in with form tutors and staff.

Wellbeing is also woven into the curriculum, e.g.: through PHSE, assemblies and subject links that promote emotional literacy, resilience, and empathy.

We regularly acknowledge national wellbeing events, such as MH awareness week and Anti-bullying week. .

The impact of our approach is evaluated through student surveys, attendance, behavior tracking and safeguarding data which inform targeted interventions.

Our student voice is central - wellbeing ambassadors and school councils help shape the support we offer.

A previous pupil questionnaire presented a positive perspective from pupils.  There was 100% agreement with most of the following statements, with few exceptions:

They are happy at school

They feel safe at school

They have fun at school

They are proud of the school

They value difference

They treat each other with respect

They are kind

They try hard to be resilient

They always have someone to talk to

We subscribe to the MH and WB charter and organise activities - informal coffee catchups, wellbeing boards, staff shout out.

Overall, our aim is to create a safe, nurturing environment where every learner can thrive academically and emotionally.

[SOURCE: OFSTED Inspection Preparation English DRAFT (1).docx | Ofsted 26 Victoria /Governor Questions and Model Answers | Modified: 2025-06-17]

OFSTED Inspection Preparation: English

Key Questions and Model Answers (DRAFT)

Ian Davies, Link Governor, English

Areas of focus

The October 2023 inspection highlighted three critical areas requiring improvement for English (phonics, reading, writing):

Weakest Readers Support: "The school does not give the weakest readers the support they need. Pupils read books that do not match precisely enough the sounds they know" 

Assessment Effectiveness: "The school does not use assessment as effectively as it could to check and ensure that pupils remember what they have learned in the longer term"

Staff Capability: "Not all staff know how to support pupils well. This is both in early reading and in some foundation subjects"

Evidence summary

The improvements implemented since the October 2023 inspection demonstrate measurable progress:

Phonics Screening Results: 91% pass rate in 2024, significantly above national and local authority averages

External Validation: School Effectiveness Adviser and local authority visits confirm improved provision – CONFIRM DATES

Consistent Teaching Quality: All classes now taught to a good standard, addressing previous variability 

Improved Knowledge Retention: Pupils demonstrating better recall and higher proportions achieving age-related expectations

These improvements provide evidence that the school has systematically addressed each of the key concerns raised in the original 'Requires Improvement' judgment, demonstrating the sustained improvement necessary for a positive re-inspection outcome.

Potential questions and model (suggested) answers

1. Early Reading and Phonics Support

Question: "How have governors ensured that addressing the weakest readers and phonics provision has become a strategic priority for the school, and what evidence can you show me of your involvement in setting this direction?"

Suggested Answer: Working closely with the headteacher, the Governing Board has supported rapid and effective change to deliver measurable improvement in all areas of concern outlined by the previous OFSTED report. The School Improvement plan was revised to ensure that supporting the weakest readers became the top strategic priority. Minutes from Governing Body meetings evidence the importance the board has placed on supporting the school staff to deliver improvement.

Question: "What specific changes have been made to ensure the weakest readers receive effective support, and how is the school ensuring reading books are precisely matched to the sounds pupils know?"

Suggested answer: Our 2024 Year 1 phonics screening check pass rate rose to 91%, exceeding the national 80.3% and Hertfordshire 81.3% averages. This demonstrates a marked improvement in early reading and has been validated by external reviews, with our School Effectiveness Adviser and a local authority commissioned visit noting significantly stronger phonics provision.

The School achieved this by implementing the Little Wandle phonics scheme, establishing a rigorous and consistent approach to early reading across the school. Pupils' reading books are now fully decodable and precisely matched to the sounds they have been taught, ensuring that even the weakest readers can practice with texts aligned to their phonics knowledge, addressing that particular concern. 

The school also introduced daily catch-up interventions and more forensic, frequent assessments to quickly identify any child falling behind, and this targeted support has rapidly boosted the fluency and confidence of our previously struggling readers.

Question: "How do you monitor the effectiveness of your phonics provision, and what evidence can you show me of improved outcomes for struggling readers?"

Suggested Answer: The school has implemented systematic monitoring procedures that track individual pupil progress through regular phonics assessments and reading fluency checks. Internal data shows that pupils can confidently recall key knowledge from earlier in the year, and a greater proportion of children are achieving age-related expectations in core subjects than previously [2].

2. Assessment and Knowledge Retention

Question: "How have you improved your assessment practices to ensure pupils remember what they learn in the longer term, and how do you use this information to adapt your curriculum delivery?"

Suggested Answer: Pupils are now retaining their learning much more effectively over time, and our internal data shows improved attainment as a result of improved assessment practices. Teaching staff have embedded a robust cycle of assessment and curriculum review - teachers now regularly recap prior learning and use quizzes and retrieval practice to strengthen long-term memory.

Subject leaders also conduct deeper reviews to monitor how well knowledge is sticking and to reinforce any content that pupils struggle to remember. Crucially, teachers now use assessment information far more effectively to inform their planning - they  are better-able to quickly identify gaps and revisit material as needed, ensuring new knowledge builds securely on what pupils have learned before.

Question: "Can you demonstrate how teachers use assessment information to identify and address gaps in pupils' phonics knowledge?"

Suggested Answer: The School has introduced more frequent assessments to quickly identify any child falling behind in phonics. Teachers now conduct regular sound checks and reading assessments that directly inform their daily planning [2]. When gaps are identified, immediate intervention is provided through daily catch-up sessions, aiming to ensure no child falls further behind.

3. Staff Training and Capability

Question: "What specific training have you provided to ensure all staff can effectively support pupils with early reading, and how do you monitor the impact of this training?"

Suggested Answer: Teaching is now more consistent across the school, and this is reflected in better support for pupils and improved progress in lessons. The latest monitoring found all classes being taught to a good standard, which is a notable step up from the variability seen at the time of the last inspection.

This improvement stems from robust action to raise staff skills - the school delivered targeted training to address gaps in subject knowledge and ensured new teaching strategies were embedded through follow-up monitoring. Where any teacher was struggling, individual improvement plans were put in place with clear expectations.

At the same time, the school bolstered support for new teachers through strengthened mentoring - pairing early career teachers with experienced mentors and introduced structured intervention programmes for pupils who need extra help, training our staff to deliver these effectively.

Question: "How do you ensure consistency in phonics teaching across all classes, and what monitoring systems do you have in place?"

Suggested Answer: The School has implemented the Little Wandle phonics scheme consistently across all classes, providing staff with a clear, structured approach to phonics instruction. Regular monitoring visits by senior leaders ensure fidelity to the programme, and ongoing coaching support is provided, where needed.

As governors, we have closely monitored all these measures and we can see the impact - teachers are now far more confident and effective in the classroom, and pupils receive much better support in both early reading and foundation subjects.

[SOURCE: Ofsted model questions and answers as discussed with SL Susan Holmes v4.docx | Ofsted 26 Victoria /Governor Questions and Model Answers | Modified: 2025-06-17]

Susan Holmes – Ofsted practice questions discussed with Maths SL at Victoria

From NGA Ofsted course

in terms of student development, what do you hope the curriculum will achieve by the time students leave this school 

This is the intent section of the subject action plan

We intend to create confident, resilient and independent mathematicians who transfer skills and knowledge to solve problems. We aim for children to achieve mastery in this subject by using a concrete, pictorial and abstract approach to enable them to delve deeper and develop their reasoning skills. Maths teaching at Victoria is creative and interactive, with practical resources to help children build their skills and understanding over time. Our values-based approach, underpinned by the school’s Christian vision, aims is to give them solid foundations, the curiosity to take their mathematical learning further and the resilience to embrace future mathematical challenges.

What do you know about how Maths is taught and how teachers are supported in delivering it

Described in Maths Subject Action Plan, discussed with subject lead at governor link visit 17/06/2025

Establish a consistent approach to teaching of maths through non-negotiables, high expectations and quality planning. 

Teachers to uplevel their knowledge and skills to ensure their vocabulary is accurate and clear.

Ensure teachers have a solid understanding of a fluency session and how to deliver it

Success criteria

Lesson observations demonstrate misconceptions are effectively addressed so children’s learning moves forward. 

Fluency sessions are fast paced, all children are engaged in learning and there are opportunities to revisit and deepen understanding. 

Working walls are used effectively to promote core learning and key vocabulary.

The SL monitors the teaching of Maths through lesson visits and book looks and gives constructive feedback.

How it is done:

Discussed with SL : many visits from TLAs: details summarised here

established non- negotiables for teaching maths. Lesson drop in with TLA to Cedar class. 

Learning walk carried out with Becky Roberts and Laura Dell 

TLA visit on 16.01.25 – Laura taught in both Year 1 classes to model pedagogy, manipulatives and R + R sheets. 

TLA led a staff meeting on 28.01.25 focused on R + R, I do – we do and CPA to uplevel knowledge and skills. TAs were invited to this staff meeting. 

Key features and techniques that we discussed:

Learn, practice (or rehearse), Apply

concrete, pictorial and abstract approach (CPA)

I do, we do, you do

In a "Maths Mastery" lesson using the "I Do, We Do, You Do" approach, the teacher first demonstrates the skill (I Do), then guides students through practice together (We Do), and finally allows students to apply the skill independently (You Do). 

Rehearsal and Reasoning sheets support many of the learning sequences. These provide children with the opportunity to gain more insight into the core ideas of each step.

Fluency, stem sentences, working walls, scaffolding

Stem sentences - The use of precise mathematical language is promoted-  Children are encouraged to speak in full sentences when they reply to questions. 

Keep up not catch up approach

These enable the children to develop fluency, problem-solving skills, and mathematical reasoning from an early age

Subject leader monitoring– Miss Gordon has done a Maths Mastery course and is rolling out ideas and methods from it across the school . She also does book looks, learning walks, pupil voice, lesson preparation checks to monitor the progress. TLAs – Teacher Learning Advisors -  visits occur throughout the year, approx. monthly

KS1 staff understand planning concepts, collaborative with SL

More generic answer

school uses well-established schemes -Hertfordshire ‘Essential Maths’ plans. Teaching is carefully sequenced, breaking down mathematical concepts into small, manageable steps, and ensuring that knowledge builds progressively from Reception through Year 2. Lessons typically follow a structure that includes practice, application, and reasoning, 

Teachers are well supported through a range of measures. They have access to high-quality planning and assessment resources, such as the HfL Essential Maths materials and Maths Mastery courses

The use of precise mathematical language is promoted-  Children are encouraged to speak in full sentences when they reply to questions. Assessment is continuous, partly using Pixl assessment—including pupil feedback, work scrutiny, and testing—to inform teaching and provide timely interventions where needed. 

what evidence do you look at to assess the impact of the curriculum on student outcomes 

Ongoing methods : formative and summative

Formative methods 

use of questioning in lesson; book looks, 

fluency sessions to overcome misconceptions

Pupil voice

Stem sentences

Maths  mastery

Oracy

Summative:

SATS at KS1

Diagnostic papers, quizzes

Pixl has been used to aid transition to TC, won’t be used in future as not useful enough

Where there are gaps, interventions are planned

How do you support school leaders in addressing any challenges related to curriculum delivery or student progress 

Governor link visits termly, feedback after meetings with SEA, progress reports at governing board and committee meetings

How do you ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and adaptive to the changing needs  of students 

School follows the national curriculum. It stays relevant because it is what they have to teach. Refresher courses spring, summer, autumn to check any changes. Training sessions keep them up-to-date with the curriculum changes

Adaptive

Prioritise what needs to be taught

Work is done with scaffolding, maths in smaller steps. There is room in HFL course to spend longer on a topic if necessary, use smaller steps. Fluency exercises can guide this and prompt interventions. Pace appropriate to class

Keep up not catch up approach

[SOURCE: Finance questions.docx | Ofsted 26 Victoria /Governor Questions and Model Answers | Modified: 2025-06-17]

Finance questions

Question 1: How is the school’s budget managed and monitored, and how do you ensure spending aligns with the school’s priorities and development plan?


Our school’s budget is managed and monitored through a rigorous, transparent process that ensures all spending directly supports our school’s priorities, and in particular the objectives set out in our School Development Plan (SDP).

Budget Planning and Alignment with Priorities
Each year, the Headteacher and School Finance Lead draft the budget in close consultation with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT), ensuring that allocations are mapped explicitly to the school’s strategic priorities. For example, staffing levels have been maintained at Victoria for the coming year, despite the falling pupil numbers. The higher level of staffing will be directed towards boosting and intervention activities, in-line with the SDP.

During the annual budgeting process we also conduct multi-year financial planning, considering projected pupil numbers and staffing needs, to ensure the sustainability of our initiatives. For example in this year's process we discussed the falling birth rates and admission numbers quite substantially but we were still able to meet all current budget requests due to the strong financial position of the school. 

Governance and Oversight
The Resources Committee of the Governing Body meets at least four times per year to review detailed budget monitoring reports, additionally the full governing board also reviews these at least twice a year. These reports show actual expenditure against each budget line, highlight any variances, and provide narrative explanations. Governors are proactive in challenging spending decisions, ensuring they are evidence-based and linked to pupil outcomes. For example in February resources we discussed spending on subject specific budgets in particular as the finance reports showed an underspend of around £7k. We were reassured that all necessary funding was being made available to subject leads and were given the example of the ZooLab wow day which had been provided recently.

Accountability and Compliance
Governors annually review and approve financial policies and ensure compliance with the Schools Financial Value Standard (SFVS). All spending is subject to audit, and a clear trail of decisions is maintained. Our most recent accounts audit passed without any areas of concern.

Question 2: What financial skills and expertise does the governing board possess, and how do you ensure effective challenge and support in budget management?


As a finance governor, I can confirm that our governing board possesses a strong and diverse range of financial skills and expertise, which enables us to provide both effective challenge and support in the management of the school’s budget.

Financial Skills and Expertise on the Board
We conduct an annual skills audit using the National Governance Association (NGA) framework to identify the knowledge and experience within our team, including financial experience, and to highlight any gaps that need addressing through recruitment or training. 

We regularly access training through the local authority and the NGA to keep up to date with best practice in school financial management. Governors are supported through induction mentoring, and ongoing training refreshers to ensure all members are confident in their financial oversight role. We have one governor who specifically monitors governor training to ensure we are covering all of the areas needed.

Our board includes governors with professional backgrounds in finance, business management, legal, and charity management. For example I have 20+ years in financial services and banking, including running business units of banks, our chair is a qualified solicitor and the (retiring) Chair of our Resources Committee is the CEO of a charity. This breadth of expertise ensures we can interpret financial reports, understand funding streams, and contribute to strategic financial planning.

Ensuring Effective Challenge and Support
We ensure effective challenge and support in several ways:

Regular, Timely Financial Monitoring: The finance committee meets at least termly to review detailed, up-to-date budget monitoring reports prepared by the School Finance Lead. We scrutinise variances, discuss virements, and monitor the forecast year-end position for both revenue and capital. For example at our February meeting the governors questioned an overspend on the schools water budget. 

Linking Finance to Strategic Priorities: All financial decisions are explicitly linked to the school’s development plan and strategic objectives. Governors challenge leaders to demonstrate how spending proposals will impact pupil outcomes and school improvement. For example we in the February Resources Committee we discussed benchmarking data which showed the substantial investments being made in interventions and boosting activities.

Question 3: How do you ensure that the school achieves value for money in its spending, including procurement and staffing decisions?

To ensure the school achieves value for money in all spending—including procurement and staffing decisions—the governing board follows a structured, transparent approach rooted in best practice and continuous evaluation.

Procurement and Purchasing Decisions
The governors are closely involved in all strategic investment decisions. For example there is currently a sub-committee reviewing the sustainability approach for the schools. This includes looking at things like boiler efficiency, window and wall insulation and potential investments like solar panels. In considering these purchasing decisions the governors are actively discussing and balancing short-term investments needs with long-term bill reduction opportunities.

For these kinds of decisions (once approved in principle) we then operate a clear procurement policy that typically mandates obtaining at least three quotes for all purchases above a set threshold, ensuring competitive pricing and fair assessment of bids. When assessing quotes, we use defined award criteria that balance price, quality, and supplier reputation. For example we replaced our telephone system earlier this year and managed to do so with a high quality system from a reputable supplier whilst remaining below budget due to our robust procurement process.

Staffing and Workforce Management
Staffing is our largest area of expenditure, so we regularly review staffing structures to ensure they align with the school’s current and future needs, as outlined in the School Development Plan. We consider the cost-effectiveness of all roles and use benchmarking data to compare our staffing spend with similar schools. Where appropriate, we use flexible staffing solutions, such as one-year contracts, to manage short-term needs efficiently without compromising on long-term flexibility. This has been particularly true of our additional intervention and boosting staff - many of whom are on one-year contracts.

Question 4: Can you provide examples of how financial decisions have directly impacted pupil outcomes or the quality of education?


Financial decisions made by the governing board are always focused on improving pupil outcomes and the quality of education, and we regularly review the impact of our spending to ensure it is making a measurable difference.

Probably the most tangible example of this was as a result of the last ofsted inspection. Quickly following this the HoS Lisa identified the need to replace the existing reading scheme and to boost intervention activities. Resources were immediately made available for these additional investments. 

Targeted Investment in Learning Resources
More generally though we allocate funding each year to update and enhance learning resources, such as books, technology, and classroom materials. For example £5000 has been budgeted at Victoria for the coming year for curriculum resources and a further £3.5k for curriculum subscriptions. The impact of these investments is closely observed during our various link visits.

Staffing and Intervention Programmes
We prioritise funding for high-quality teaching and targeted intervention programmes, recognising that smaller class sizes and additional support staff can have a significant impact—especially for disadvantaged pupils. Despite the small class sizes at Victoria we have also been able to invest in specific intervention activities - such as additional reading support for the pupils who need it.


Professional Development
Investing in staff professional development is another key area. In particular in Victoria we have a couple of ECT’s who are actively mentored and supported by more senior staff members and who are progressing extremely well as a result.

Monitoring and Evaluation
All major spending decisions are reviewed for impact using pupil progress data, feedback from staff and pupils, and external benchmarks. Where spending does not have the intended impact, we reallocate resources to more effective strategies.

[SOURCE: Safeguarding Questions.docx | Ofsted 26 Victoria /Governor Questions and Model Answers | Modified: 2025-06-16]

Safeguarding Questions

How does the Governing Body assure itself that safeguarding is effective in the school?

The Governing Body receives regular safeguarding reports from the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) which in our case is the Head of School, including updates on training, referrals, and policy implementation. We conduct an annual safeguarding audit as well as a termly review which also looks at the Single Central Record (SCR). The Safeguarding Link Governor meets with the DSL each term to review case studies and ensure procedures are followed. We also ensure all governors complete annual safeguarding training.

How do you ensure that safeguarding policies and procedures are up to date and followed?

Our safeguarding policy is reviewed annually and updated in line with the latest KCSIE guidance. The policy is ratified by the full Governing Body and shared with all staff. We monitor implementation through governor visits, staff feedback, and safeguarding audits. The DSL provides assurance that all staff have read and understood the policy, and we check this during link governor visits.

How do you know that staff are trained and confident in safeguarding procedures?

We receive termly reports on staff training, including induction for new staff and annual refresher training. The DSL ensures all staff complete training on KCSIE and Prevent. Governors verify this through training logs and discussions during visits. We also review the outcomes of any safeguarding incidents to ensure staff have responded appropriately and confidently. Governors also ask safeguarding related questions of staff during Governor visits.

How does the Governing Body ensure that pupils feel safe and know how to keep themselves safe?

We monitor pupil voice through surveys and discussions during governor visits. The curriculum includes PSHE and online safety education, and we ensure this is regularly reviewed. Governors also review safeguarding logs and behaviour data to identify trends. Feedback from pupils indicates they feel safe and know who to talk to if they have concerns.

What is your role in managing allegations against staff or safeguarding concerns involving adults?

We follow statutory guidance and the school’s safeguarding policy. The Chair of Governors is the designated point of contact for allegations against the Headteacher. We ensure that all allegations are reported to the Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) and that procedures are followed rigorously. We also ensure confidentiality and support for all parties involved.

How do you ensure the Single Central Record (SCR) is compliant and up to date?

The SCR is reviewed termly by the Safeguarding Link Governor alongside the DSL and school business manager. We check that all required checks are recorded, including DBS, identity, qualifications, and right to work. Any anomalies are addressed immediately. We also ensure that the SCR is securely stored and accessible for inspection.

How do you monitor the effectiveness of safeguarding across the school, including online safety?

We receive regular updates on safeguarding trends, including online safety incidents, through the DSL’s reports (included in the Head of School report). The curriculum includes online safety education, and we review its impact through pupil voice and incident logs. Governors also review filtering and monitoring systems to ensure they are effective and compliant with DfE guidance.

How do you ensure that safeguarding is part of the school’s culture and not just a compliance exercise?

We promote a safeguarding-first culture by embedding it in all aspects of school life. This includes regular staff briefings, visible safeguarding displays, and open communication channels for pupils and staff. Governors observe this culture during visits and through feedback from staff and pupils. We also ensure safeguarding is a standing item on every governing board agenda.

How do you ensure that vulnerable pupils are identified and supported effectively?

We monitor the provision for vulnerable pupils through reports from the DSL, SENCO, and pastoral team. The Safeguarding Link Governor reviews case studies and anonymised data to understand how early help and external referrals are managed. We also ensure that staff are trained to identify signs of vulnerability and that interventions are timely and effective.

How do you evaluate the impact of safeguarding training for staff and governors?

We evaluate training impact through staff surveys, safeguarding audits, and incident reviews. Governors discuss training outcomes with the DSL and ensure that learning is applied in practice. We also reflect on safeguarding case studies to assess whether staff have responded appropriately and identify areas for further development.

How do you ensure that the school’s filtering and monitoring systems are effective in protecting pupils online?

We review the school’s filtering and monitoring systems termly to ensure they are robust and compliant with DfE guidance. The DSL provides reports on online safety incidents and the effectiveness of the systems in place. We also ensure that staff and pupils receive regular training on online safety and responsible internet use.

How do you ensure that online safety education is embedded in the curriculum?

Online safety education is integrated into the PSHE curriculum and reinforced through assemblies and workshops. We review the curriculum regularly to ensure it addresses current online risks and trends. Governors also seek feedback from pupils and staff to ensure the education provided is relevant and effective.

Susan Holmes – Ofsted practice questions

From NGA Ofsted course

Perplexity (write a school governor reply for a Hertfordshire school for EYFS and KS1 (ages 4 -7 ) to the question 'How do you support school leaders in addressing any challenges related to curriculum delivery or student progress'

what evidence do you look at to assess the impact of the curriculum on student outcomes 

We  look at a range of evidence to assess the impact of the curriculum on student outcomes:

Statutory Assessment Data:
We review outcomes from statutory assessments, such as the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Profile at the end of Reception, the Year 1 Phonics Screening Check, and end of Key Stage 1 assessments in reading, writing, and mathematics. These provide a benchmark for how well children are achieving against national expectations

Ongoing Teacher Assessment and Progress Data:
we consider teacher assessments and data from regular, in-school tracking ( Pixl for Maths and other subjects) , which show how well children are progressing through the curriculum. This includes both formative assessments (such as observations and in-lesson questioning) and summative assessments (such as quizzes and end-of-unit tasks) 

Work Scrutiny and Moderation:
We do book looks -  looking at samples of pupils’ work across the curriculum to check coverage, progression, and the depth of learning. 

Pupil Voice and Engagement:
Staff get feedback from children about what they have learned and how confident they feel, 

Subject Leader and Headteacher Reports:
we review regular reports from subject leaders and the headteacher, which summarise strengths, areas for development, and the impact of any changes or interventions on learning and progress. We have termly governor link visits.

External Reviews and Benchmarking:
We also look at findings from external reviews, such as local authority advisors, and compare school performance to local and national data to ensure our curriculum is having the intended impact for all groups of pupils

The inspection focussed on Maths ; what do you know about how this subject is taught and how teachers are supported in delivering it

Our school uses well-established schemes such as the Hertfordshire ‘Essential Maths’ plans. Teaching is carefully sequenced, breaking down mathematical concepts into small, manageable steps, and ensuring that knowledge builds progressively from Reception through Year 2. Lessons typically follow a structure that includes practice, application, and reasoning, 

Key features and techniques that we discussed:

Learn, practice (or rehearse), Apply

I do, we do, you do

In a "Maths Mastery" lesson using the "I Do, We Do, You Do" approach, the teacher first demonstrates the skill (I Do), then guides students through practice together (We Do), and finally allows students to apply the skill independently (You Do). 

Rehearsal and Reasoning sheets support many of the learning sequences. These provide children with the opportunity to gain more insight into the core ideas of each step.

These enable the children to develop fluency, problem-solving skills, and mathematical reasoning from an early age

Teachers are well supported through a range of measures. They have access to high-quality planning and assessment resources, such as the HfL Essential Maths materials, which provide detailed learning sequences and guidance for each year group. 

Subject leader monitoring– Miss Gordon has done a Maths Mastery course and is rolling out ideas and methods from it across the school . She also does book looks, learning walks, pupil voice, lesson preparation checks to monitor the progress. TLAs – Teacher Learning Advisors -  visits occur throughout the year

The use of precise mathematical language is promoted-  Children are encouraged to speak in full sentences when they reply to questions. Assessment is continuous, partly using Pixl assessment—including pupil feedback, work scrutiny, and testing—to inform teaching and provide timely interventions where needed. 

How do you ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and adaptive to the changing needs  of students 

we ensure the curriculum remains relevant and adaptive through a close partnership with school leaders and staff

Alignment with EYFS and Key Stage 1 Frameworks:
We check to ensure the curriculum fully meets the statutory requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) for Reception (age 4-5) and the National Curriculum for Key Stage 1 (Years 1 and 2, ages 5-7). This guarantees a strong foundation in communication, literacy, numeracy, and personal development, while allowing flexibility to tailor learning to our pupils’ needs

Regular Curriculum Review and Adaptation:
The curriculum is reviewed frequently to reflect changes in government guidance, educational research, and the developmental needs of young children. This includes adapting teaching approaches to incorporate play-based learning in EYFS and more structured but still engaging learning in Key Stage 1

Staff Development and Innovation:
We try to ensure  ongoing professional development for teachers to keep up with best practices in early years and primary education, including new approaches to teaching foundational skills and fostering creativity and curiosity

Holistic Development:
Beyond academic skills, the curriculum promotes physical development, social skills, and emotional well-being, recognising the whole child’s needs at this formative stage

Through this approach, we ensure that our curriculum not only meets statutory requirements but also evolves to meet the unique and changing needs of our youngest learners, preparing them well for the next stages of their education.

How do you support school leaders in addressing any challenges related to curriculum delivery or student progress 

Strategic Oversight and Setting Direction

the governing body works to set high expectations and clear targets for pupil achievement, ensuring that the curriculum in EYFS and KS1 meets statutory requirements and reflects the needs of all learners

We regularly review the School Improvement Plan (SIP) and Self Evaluation Form (SEF) to identify priority areas and monitor progress against agreed objectives

Acting as a Critical Friend

We maintain a positive, supportive relationship with school leaders, meeting regularly to discuss progress, challenges, and areas for development.

We ask probing questions about pupil progress, the effectiveness of interventions, and how the curriculum is adapted to support all children, including those with additional needs1

we encourage leaders to reflect on what is working well and where further improvements can be made, particularly in early reading, phonics, and foundational skills essential for later learning

Monitoring and Accountability

The governing body receives regular reports from the headteacher and phase leaders on pupil attainment and progress data, including breakdowns by year group, subject, and key groups such as disadvantaged pupils and those with SEND

We scrutinise this information to ensure that gaps are identified early and that swift, effective action is taken to address underperformance

Governors participate in learning walks, book looks, and attend school events to see the curriculum in action and understand the pupil experience first-hand

Professional Development and Collaboration

We support leaders in accessing high-quality training and development opportunities, both through Hertfordshire’s governance services and local networks45.

Governors encourage collaboration with other local schools to share best practice and learn from successful approaches to curriculum delivery and raising standards5.

Championing All Pupils

The governing body ensures the curriculum is inclusive and broad, providing for the spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development of all children1.

We monitor the impact of strategies to support vulnerable groups and challenge leaders to ensure that every child in EYFS and KS1 is given the best possible start to their education12.

Summary Statement

By providing strategic direction, acting as a critical friend, ensuring robust accountability, and championing professional development, we help ensure that every child receives a high-quality education and achieves their full potential

can you give examples of how the board has responded to any areas where students may not be achieving as expected 

School Governor Response: Board Actions When Students Are Not Achieving as Expected (EYFS and KS1)

Data Scrutiny and Challenge

The board regularly reviews detailed pupil progress and attainment data, provided termly by the headteacher and senior leadership team. When data shows that certain groups—such as disadvantaged pupils or those with SEND—are not meeting expected standards, governors challenge leaders to explain the reasons and outline actions being taken to address these gaps

We place particular scrutiny on the progress of vulnerable groups and the effective use of Pupil Premium funding to ensure targeted support is in place for those most at risk of underachievement

Policy Review and Implementation

Governors annually review and approve key policies, including those related to teaching, learning, and inclusion. We ask the headteacher to provide real examples of how these policies have been enacted to support pupils who are not achieving as expected, ensuring that policy translates into effective practice

Performance Management and Target Setting

The governing board is actively involved in the headteacher’s performance management, setting and reviewing targets that often include specific objectives for improving outcomes in EYFS and KS1. We also scrutinise staff performance management reports to ensure that all teachers are held accountable for pupil progress and that support or training is provided where needed

Commissioning Additional Support and Interventions

When underachievement is identified, the board supports leaders in accessing additional resources or expertise. For example, we have encouraged participation in Hertfordshire’s Early Years Diminishing the Difference programme and the Early Years Transition Project, both designed to raise attainment for children with low starting points and improve transitions into school

We have also supported the use of external advisors, such as Hertfordshire Improvement Partners, to provide guidance and challenge around closing attainment gaps

Workforce Development 

The board has endorsed further training for staff on effective intervention approaches and transition guidance, ensuring that children at risk of falling behind receive the right support at the right time

Monitoring Impact

Governors monitor the impact of all interventions and strategies through follow-up data reviews, learning walks, and meetings with staff. Where progress remains insufficient, we work with leaders to adapt approaches and, if necessary, allocate additional resources or seek further external support

In summary, the board takes a proactive and systematic approach to addressing areas where students may not be achieving as expected, combining robust data analysis, policy oversight, targeted intervention, and ongoing monitoring to ensure every child in EYFS and KS1 is supported to reach their full potential

in terms of student development, what do you hope the curriculum will achieve by the time students leave this school

--- Slide 15 ---
Curriculum intent, implementation, impact
Governors need to know
Why we teach what we do?
How we teach it, and the sequence in which we teach it?
The various types of pupil outcomes that are generated
How we revise practice in light of this?
What role do we play in framing intent and assessing impact?
How do we remain informed about the work of teachers and curriculum leaders?

--- Slide 16 ---
Subject knowledge and understanding
Does subject teaching develop the knowledge and understanding of pupils?
Can pupils demonstrate mastery by applying this knowledge and understanding in a range of contexts?
Can pupils demonstrate progression in their learning over time?
Are teachers accurate and confident in their subject knowledge?
Do we have strategies in place to develop this further?
Do we meet the statutory requirements? 

--- Slide 17 ---
Cultural capital
178. As part of making the judgement about the quality of education, inspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life. Our understanding of ‘knowledge and cultural capital’ is derived from the following wording in the national curriculum: 
‘It is the essential knowledge that pupils need to be educated citizens, introducing them to the best that has been thought and said and helping to engender an appreciation of human creativity and achievement.’ 

--- Slide 18 ---
Cultural capital
The world can be an exciting place full of music, art, places to go, people to find out about, sports to do and experiences to have. 
We all have a cultural capital – we can expand this. 
Think about what skills, knowledge and language pupils need to access the curriculum?
Regardless of a child’s background, there may be gaps. 
How do you check on this?

--- Slide 19 ---
safeguarding
Standing item on Full Board agendas
The Single Central Record needs to be accurate and periodically monitored

Governance in the Context of Leadership

Causing Concern

Governors/trustees do not carry out their statutory core functions.

Their contribution to the school’s strategic aims is weak.

There may be serious breaches of legal responsibilities that negatively impact pupils.

Leaders may fail to identify or act on key issues, and there is no track record of improvement.

Secure

Governance has an accurate understanding of the school’s context, strengths, and weaknesses.

This understanding informs the actions they take.

Leaders’ actions are well judged and consistently effective.

Strong

Governors/trustees challenge and support leaders effectively.

They monitor the impact of decisions and ensure accountability.

Governance contributes to a clear strategic direction and improvement planning.

Exemplary

Governance is embedded and sustained over time.

It makes a tangible difference to pupils’ learning, development, and well-being.

Governance practices are used or adapted internally to improve other areas of the school.

These practices are subject to moderation and confirmation by the national quality and consistency panel.

Please note:
We advise caution over the use of school performance data since the pandemic, as this had an uneven impact on di erent schools and
pupils. The data is best used as a starting point for discussion, for example to explore the impact of Covid on pupil performance.
There were no published  gures for 2020 or 2021, as statutory assessment was cancelled in these years due to Covid.
Data is suppressed for pupil groups of 5 or fewer and the complementary group, e.g. Disadvantaged and Non-disadvantaged.
‘Disadvantaged’ relates to pupils who are eligible for Free School Meals or have been eligible at any point in the last 6 years.

Length of visit: Half a day plus preparation and report writing (Spring visit 2)

Purpose of visit and activities undertaken: To review the quality of behaviour and attitudes across the school.
This visit consisted of:
Discussion with leaders about key policies relating to behavioural matters and the implementation across the school 
Exploration of recording of incidents on the school’s online behaviour monitoring system (CPOMS)
Exploration of the Behaviour Curriculum
Visit classes to observe behaviour for learning in practice
Review of attendance data, systems and processes
Review of case studies including risk reduction and behaviour plans
Discussion with an ECT regarding support provided in relation to ensuring high quality behaviour and attitudes.
A discussion with a small group of children about matters relating to behaviour and attitudes
A review of information relating to behaviour and attitudes on the school website 
Feedback to a member of the governing body

Context
Victoria CE Infant and Nursery School was last inspected in October 2023 and the strengths in behaviour and attitudes was explicitly highlighted in the report:
“Victoria is a safe and orderly place. Pupils are happy here. They enjoy positive relationships with caring staff. Children in the early years learn and play in a stimulating environment. They build their curiosity and independence. Pupils understand and embody the school’s values.”
“There are high expectations of behaviour. This helps pupils focus in lessons. They behave well in breaks and as they walk around the school. Pupils respond well to clear routines. They learn to be considerate, such as through the ‘Kindness Week’.”
“The school has a well-considered behaviour policy. Leaders have communicated this carefully to staff and pupils. As a result, the policy is consistently applied. Any incidents get resolved quickly. Leaders deal with the underlying causes of misbehaviour and low attendance. Therefore, pupils attend and behave well.”
Information taken from the current Inspection Data School Report (IDSR) shows that attendance levels at Victoria CE Infant and Nursery School over the past three years have continued to improve over time.  The most recent published data shows that attendance and persistent absence is better than the national average.


Information on this database is historic but is used by the inspectorate to gain a picture of outcomes over time.
There were 5 suspensions recorded in 2022-2023 (latest published data). The reason for the suspensions was physical abuse towards adults.  
The data on the IDSR shows that 13 pupils are in receipt of SEND support. Primary presenting strands include speech language and communication needs (SLCN), autistic spectrum diagnosis (ASD) and physical disability (PD).  The largest group have non-specific presenting needs.
The school website represents well information relating to the strands relating to behaviour and attitudes. Policies are robust, regularly updated, relevant and in line with statutory responsibilities.  Of particular note is the Vision and Values statement, Attendance policy, Behaviour Ladder, E safety guidance, Golden Rules, and information relating to the work of the Kindness and Spiritual ambassadors.  These set the tone for the high expectations around behaviour, attitudes and ethos at the school.

Additional observations: 
Leaders consistently prioritise positive behaviour and attitudes and the strengths of provision in this area are transparent and have been enhanced still further through actions taken by the leaders to rapidly improve the quality of education in the school and further widen and enrich the personal development offer.  The strands of behaviour and attitudes and the high quality curriculum offer align.  Children are engaged and motivated, want to learn and so their behaviour for learning is consistently observed to be of a high standard in this school.
The pupil questionnaire administered earlier in the school year presents a positive perspective from the pupils in relation to their behaviour and attitudes. There was 100% agreement with most of the statements below, with few exceptions.  For example:
They are happy at the school
They feel safe at school
They have fun at school
They are proud of the school
They value difference
They treat each other with respect
They are kind
They are thankful
They try hard to be resilient
They have someone to talk to
They know the difference between right and wrong and how to respond if something is wrong
They follow the school values and model them to others
They understand how to make others feel welcome
They understand if they are unkind this can make others upset
They understand the importance of having rules
They understand the consequences of their behaviour and actions.
The analysis of absence is forensic and monitored with precision.  Leaders are strict about not authorising absence beyond the stated circumstances in the school’s revised Attendance policy (last reviewed September 2024 in line with the statutory guidance.)  Reasons for absence are ascertained and appropriate support is provided through the Family Support Worker and EBSA(emotionally based school avoidance) strategies for specific children and their families according to the presenting need.  At the time of the visit there were 8 children who were being closely monitored as persistent absentees.  One child was in receipt of alternative provision.  This has been carefully planned and is being tenaciously monitored for impact.  This has proved to be challenging on account of a lack of communication from other parties working in support of the child.

Discussion with pupils
Pupils have a positive view of their life at the school.  They like the sport and exercise opportunities to keep them healthy.  They enjoy making friends, learning new things and very much appreciate “ having such lovely teachers.”  
Their favourite parts of the school day include playing together, having the school lunches, their PE lessons and learning mathematical facts.  The explained that pupils behave very well in lessons.  There is often lots of laughter at lunchtime.  It is, from their perspective, a happy place to be.  They demonstrate a clear understanding of what happens if someone chooses not to follow the rules.  They explained the possible consequences and say that if there are any problems the matters get resolved very quickly.  They believe it is important to be a good friend to others and the most important elements of this is to be both honest and kind.  The children explain that there are good attitudes for learning at the school.  Everyone focuses on what the teacher is saying because they do not want time out.  They explained that fiddle toys are helpful and enable some children to concentrate.  They demonstrate perseverance and resilience in their learning.  They say they feel proud, happy and delighted when they try to do something difficult and get it right.  They explain that they take a pride in all aspects of their school and they feel that  having certificates, merits and a level of competition helps them to concentrate and want to achieve the very best they can in their learning.  Their social interactions are well developed and supported.  The pupils have a positive view of their school rules and understand that they are there to keep everyone safe.  They appreciate that teachers help and guide them and support them to understand the mistakes they have made when they have made poor choices in relation to behaviour. They know how to support a child who might appear to be upset or lonely.  A wonderful part of this discussion was when one child  explained the importance of “paying it forward” when people are kind to them.  The breadth of this discussion with the  children demonstrated how mature and well-formed their responses are in relation to behaviour and attitudes.  They want to be responsible, kind citizens in their approach to others and truly demonstrate their desire to live the federation’s vision to “Do everything in love.”  This is consistently observed to be well modelled to the children by the staff team.
Discussion with staff
A discussion took place with an Early Creer  Teacher.  She feels that there are strong support structures in place to support staff in the management of pupil behaviour and attitudes.  The strategies provided are especially helpful in relation to the management of repeated behaviours.  Policies relating to  behaviour management were carefully covered as part of the school’s induction programme.  Staff are aware that there is consistency in the expectations of behaviour across the school and the school has consequences as part of this process that work well for the children.  The teachers have had training in behaviour management and there has been some additional helpful training relating to the management of more complex behaviours of children with SEND, provided by the SENCo.   New staff are aware that there are staff at the school with a high level of experience and expertise and discussion with colleagues is valued because it enables staff new to the profession to learn from their expertise.  The teacher was able to provide good examples of how support has been provided to enable an improvement in behaviour for a child with specific needs.  There is a good understanding of the school’s expectations of managing classroom routines and maintaining a positive learning environment.  High expectations, clear classroom routines and structure for part of this.  The system for escalating behaviour concerns works well at the school from the ECT’s perspective.  There is effective mentorship and collaboration at the school.  Good advice and helpful strategies are provided by mentors and though discussions with the broader staff team and thy er group partner.  Helpful reflection and feedback is provided by leaders regarding the management of behaviours.  There is a clear understanding of the importance of early intervention in the management of behaviours.  The perspective of the ECT is that staff are very well supported at this school and their professional expertise and methods of feedback is highly respected.
Learning walk
A walk around the school demonstrated engaged, confident learners with excellent behaviour for learning and positive attitudes to learning.  We observed children cooperatively engaging in discussions using talk partners well.
Collective worship is a high priority in the school and this opportunity is used to model exemplary behaviour and enable children to reflect on how they will show such positive and engaging behaviours in their interactions with others.
The use of the Zones of Regulation enables children to articulate their emotions, reflect on their actions and to understand that saying sorry means that actions need to change.
Classrooms have a reflection area.  In one classroom we observe the Storyteller Bible and reflections on The Way of the Cross.
Visual daily timetables can be observed around the school.  This enables children to know what is coming next and to minimise anxieties around points of transition.
Ground rules are clearly displayed around the school, for example in relation to expectations during the PSHE lessons.  In addition the Golden Rules with actions are displayed.
Children have many opportunities to serve the local community.  These opportunities align with the British and school values.  Children are taught to respect peace, try their best, be kind, polite and helpful, look after the school environment, be gentle and honest, to listen to others, to respect individual liberty and to always seek truth and justice.  The are taught to “Do everything in love.”
Children are given movement breaks and the opportunity to participate in sensory circuits is a strategy used for some children.  These activities are designed to support each child’s sensory diet which then regulates behaviour and emotions and puts children in a position to concentrate and learn effectively.  Elements of mindfulness are also used to ground children, bring a sense of calm and enable focus on the learning.
Great care is taken to support the social, emotional and academic development of each individual child.  This started with the youngest children in the EYFS provision.  The transition level of need toolkit is used as a diagnostic tool to identify the presenting needs of individual children into the school.  This then enables the practitioner to ensure provision is put in place to support the specific needs flagged up through this assessment.  There is a clear commitment in this school to addressing needs as the earliest opportunity to ensure that this does not become a more significant challenge as children progress their education. Early intervention is key and this school acts with purpose to address such matters.  Staff work with great commitment to engage parents in the leaning process for their child as they are aware that parents are the most important and influential educators of their children.  What this means is that there is an in-depth knowledge of every child’s individual strengths and barriers to learning.
With the very youngest children high quality provision is observed.  Children learn how to become resilient learners quickly.  They learn social skills to support happy interactions.  They become independent quickly and demonstrate they are able to work cooperatively.  These strengths are attributable to the skill of the practitioners in EYFS.  Children here quickly develop their sense of belonging.  They understand that all families are unique and special and they learn from diversity models.  They celebrate difference and this builds self esteem effectively.  Children are supported to explain their feelings and this helps them to self-regulate quickly.  The learning environment in EYFS is an enabling one that provides high quality secure foundations for the next steps in learning for every child.
The school engages well with the feeder junior and secondary school.  Role models from these schools come in to share their skills with the children.  This happens through the work of the sports leaders, learning ambassadors and kindness ambassadors.  This is excellent practice and supports children’s social skills and learning development.

Discussion with leaders
The school’s uses a pro-social approach to managing behaviour using the STEPS therapeutic thinking framework.  This is outlined in the behaviour policy and ladder.  There is a clear and consistent approach.  Staff have a reflective approach to what the exhibiting behaviour is telling them and understand that all behaviour is communication of a need.  Children are clear about the rules. This was evident through discussion and observation.  The rules are recapped every week in Collective Worship.  Positive behaviours are taught.  There is follow through with behaviour ladder which shows the consequences for specific actions.  There is consistency across school which is regularly updated and communicated to staff.  For example there are published agreed consistencies for teaching assistants which require input from all staff enabling high quality engagement in the learning process for all children  The school has individual plans to support specific children’s learning and behavioural needs.  The school takes active steps to promote equity for all children.  De-escalation strategies use scripts adhering to simple repetitive instructions.  Social stories for children are prepared and some of these were shared relating to the theme of play fighting, adult interaction and making friends.  This helps the children to understand the choices made and how this can be done differently.  It is a useful tool to help pupils to manage behavioural incidents over time.  
Training with teaching assistants takes place to ensure consistency in the implementation of the behaviour policy.  This involves discussion around consequences using the therapeutic approach. The point of this is to ensure that the consequence is prompt and has restorative consequences.  In addition, the school subscribes to the programme “When the adults change, everything changes.”  This enables staff to understand the importance of modelling and consistency in their approach to the management of pupil behaviour.  They are encouraged to reflect upon what the behaviour is telling them and which strategies would be best deployed to support the situation.  Training is also included as part of the induction process for new staff to ensure alignment in approach.
The result of this approach is that staff take ownership of presenting behaviours and use a graduated response to address emerging inconsistencies.  This has empowered the staff team.  Senior leaders are involved more serious, repetitive or one-off dangerous incidents.  The Behaviour ladder is there for staff to respond in an appropriate manner. In addition parents have been educated that the class teacher should always be the first point of contact.
A helpful development to enhance the culture of  positive behaviour management observed at the school is the school’s engagement with “Compassionomics.”  This is teaching the school community about the impact of empathy on enabling everyone to feel they belong.   Advocates in the school provide exceptional support to children with social and emotional needs.

Record keeping
The school uses CPOMS to record incidents, communications and actions relating to all pupils.  This then enables commentaries and actions to be tracked and evaluated.  The approach is tenacious to ensure needs are identified and supported for individual children.  An example of a case study was shared and this clearly demonstrates adherence to the statutory requirements in paragraph  66 of “Keeping Children Safe in Education 2024”  which requires records to include:
“A clear and comprehensive summary of the concern
Details of how the concern was followed up and resolved
A note of action taken, decisions reached and the outcome.”

The quality of evidence relating to behaviour and attitudes shared and observed at Victoria CE Infant and Nursery School is exemplary and exceeds the criteria for Good as outlined in the current education inspection framework (EIF).  They key to this success is rigour and tenacity in the implementation of the behaviour policy and proactivity, curiosity and active intervention relating to attendance.  Staff are well supported and trained.  The provision is well supported by exemplary provision in personal development (evaluated on an earlier visit this academic year.)
The key for the school is to ensure confidence in the articulation of what is exceptional about the provision.  It is also about keeping an eye on the proposed changes to the EIF as outlined in the OFSTED Toolkit and ensuring the summary of self-evaluation aligns to the new descriptors (if the school ends up being inspected from September 2025, as is likely, but not definite.)

Recommendations:
To further build upon the high quality provision in behaviour and attitudes observed at the school leaders plan to:
Introduce “Storm break” as a programme to enable consistent physical movement breaks.  Leaders plan to complete the training and effective implementation of this strategy. This is designed to support children's mental health and emotional wellbeing through movement.

Further develop and implement the agreed behavioural consistencies outlined in “The Castle Way” relating to
Meet and greet and transition
Being learning ready
Lesson structure
Using a common language

Use the OFSTED Toolkit as the guide for evaluating provision in Behaviour and Attitudes to ensure this is aligned to the revied inspection framework with effect from September 2025.  The following dates provide HFL training opportunities to learn more about this:
Using the Ofsted toolkits to prepare for your next inspection​ (25/11/25; 29/1/26; 18/3/26; 29/4/26; 23/6/26 – choose one date.)

Length of visit: Half a day plus preparation and report writing (Spring visit 1)

Purpose of visit and activities undertaken: To review the quality of early reading at the school.
This visit consisted of:
A discussion with the reading lead to discuss progress since the last inspection
A learning walk to see reading groups in Year 1
Information relating to Little Wandle Assessment tracker and impact
Hear year 1 and year 2 readers in the lowest 20% for each year group
Visits to phonics lessons in Nursery, Reception, Year 1 
A review of shared and published documentation relating to early reading

Context
When the school was last inspected in October 2023 there were some action points made relating to phonics and early reading:
“Reading has not been sufficiently prioritised. Teachers deliver the phonics scheme appropriately. However, there is not enough urgency when pupils fall behind. The weakest readers do not get effective support. The books pupils read are not precisely matched to the sounds they know. Consequently, they struggle to read fluently. While this is the case, the school has developed an effective culture of reading for pleasure. For example, the library has been improved considerably.”
“The school does not give the weakest readers the support they need. 
Pupils read books that do not match precisely enough the sounds they know. This means that pupils do not learn quickly to read with fluency. 
The school needs to review the support given to early readers, and ensure that this is provided effectively, so that the weakest readers remember their sounds better and can use these to build up their skills and confidence in reading.”
Outcomes for related to phonics

There were 44 pupils who were eligible for the phonics screening check in Year 1 in 2024; all of them sat the check and 4 pupils did not meet the phonics expected standard. I of these children is a disadvantaged learner
There were 10 pupils who were eligible for the phonics screening check in Year 2 in 2024; all of them sat the check and 7 pupils did not meet the phonics expected standard.  7 of these pupils were in receipt of SEN support, 3 children were disadvantaged learners and 1 pupil had English as an Additional Language (EAL).

Reading related outcomes in Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in 2024


Main observations: 
Decisive, rapid and systematic action has been taken in response the Ofsted action points.  The success of these actions is clearly demonstrated in outcomes for early reading related outcomes in  2024.  Visits to the school confirm that there are some highly skilled practitioners who deliver the phonics and early reading programme in an effective manner.  
The school reviewed and changed its phonics teaching programme and now the school has Little Wandle Letters and Sounds revised embedded in practice.  The Assessment Tracker shared as part of this visit shows that pupil progress is meticulously tracked and tailored provision is promptly put in place for any child falling behind.
A further strength in provision is the school’s commitment to and engagement with the DFE funded English Hub Challenge.  This has ensured that the school:
Teaches with fidelity the chosen systematic synthetic phonics (SSP) programme 
Children make a strong start in reception
Teachers ensure a cumulative progression of sounds and books
Builds a team of expert reading teachers
Reaches those children falling behind the pace of the programme
Builds talking and listening activities into all activities across the school day
Develops pupils’ listening comprehension and language by reading aloud and talking bout stories, poems and non-fiction texts
Engagement with specialists with expertise in English has been impactful in enabling the school to further improve its provision in the areas of phonics, reading and writing.  A high level of commitment has been demonstrated by the school team and this is the reason for the success and rapid progress with this action point. 
The school has enacted the precise guidance given by the experts in this area.  Actions are identified in relation to the above elements for current areas of focus and the members of staff to whom these actions apply.  There is tight accountability and these actions are reviewed prior to the subsequent coaching session with the Literacy specialist who visits the school on a half termly basis.
In addition, the school uses the expertise of an HFL Teaching and Learning Adviser for English in a purposeful and effective manner.  The current focus for this work has been to provide the subject leader with writing assessment training and provide  support for the handwriting approach implementation.
The school leaders articulate, with clarity, the impact of the actions that have been taken to address the Ofsted action points relating to early reading.  The current phonics scheme has been well chosen, applied with fidelity and is impactful in terms of progression and outcomes.  Modelling strategies have grown capacity and there is an intentional commitment to ongoing and systematic training.  Assessment and monitoring strategies are being used in a purposeful manner to inform future planning for individual children.  
The choice of Little Wandle as the SSP programme was well planned.  If focuses purely on phonics and reading and the training is the highest priority. Staff are fully trained in the programme delivery before implementation.  The programme contains a thorough assessment and tracking stand which then enables forensic analysis and forward planning.  Care has been taken with the timetabling of the programme to ensure that decoding and fluency are fully embedded.  Children start the programme in Nursery, then it is followed through into Reception, Year 1 and Year 2.
Teachers are both confident and competent in their  delivery of the phonics programme.  The English Hub have validated this and these strengths were observed on this visit.  Action points are modelled and placed into staff meetings for consolidation.  Year 1 pupils are streamed in the afternoon to enable further consolidation in their learning of phonics.  The most effective practitioners support the  teaching of gaps.  Pace of the teaching sequence is observed to have become more rapid and effective. 
The school has a comprehensive summary of the intent, implementation and impact of the reading curriculum at the school.  It is aligned to the requirements of the inspection framework.  It is a helpful summary because it summarises how the intent, implementation and impact is underpinned at the school.  There is clarity about the pedagogy, how children with SEND are supported, the role of the subject leader and the formative and summative assessment strategies.  In addition the implementation is clarified through the school’s approach to teaching fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.  There is further detail related to recommended reading lists which are well represented on the school website, whole school reading related events, daily story time and 1:1 reading opportunities.  The culture of reading is well developed at the school and this is outlined in expectations regarding reading at home, reading areas in school, the school library and the support provided by reading volunteers.  Reading for pleasure was clearly indicated as a strength at the last inspection and its success has continued to grow.  The school assesses the impact in terms of pupil voice, evidence in knowledge and skills and the outcomes children achieve, which in 2024 were above national standards and the higher local standards for Hertfordshire.  
Banded books used by the school are  a mixture of  “Big Cat” and others.  The school uses the Little Wandle books which are matched to the correct phonic phase.  Books that were not decodable have been discarded.  All reading books were completely matched to phonic sounds.  A grant of £6000 from English Hub was provided to pay for the phonic scheme, resources, books and supply costs for training.  Pupil progress is tracked by the phonic phase books.  This then generates questions through pupil progress meetings to inform adjustments to planning for individual children going forward.
The school website is both informative and supportive.  The curriculum is well represented.  There is detailed guidance for parents relating to the phonics programme and reading.  This includes documents such as the reading progression plan and recommended reads for each year group. 
Strong evidence was shared in relation to parental partnership.  There is comprehensive and supportive information for parents on the school website related to phonics and through the school’s approach to engaging parents in the learning process for their child.  A phonic workshop takes place in the autumn term primarily for the Reception and Year 1 parents.  Teachers communicate the sounds the children are working through fortnightly newsletters in Reception.  The nursery newsletters concentrate on rhymes and environmental sounds and the exploration of specific sounds.  Year 1 provide this information through the homework books.  “Reading with your child” is modelled to the parents.  Parental consultation sessions provide information about gaps and reading development skills.  The school is proactive with parents regarding any reading concerns and signposts additional support.

Little Wandle Assessment Tracker 
This is working well and is carefully monitored. Leaders have been able to maximise its use due to the guidance received from the English Hub.  Overviews from Little Wandle keeps teachers and leaders on track.  This is also moderated  by teacher assessment for each child.  Heat maps are created and can identify the bottom 20% of readers.  Patterns are identified in terms of who knows the different sounds.  Reteaching then takes place where appropriate.  The tracker enables the staff to identify children needing overlearning and consolidation.  Summary analysis can be competed for different purposes and enhances the subject leader’s knowledge of individual and class performance.  Leaders insist that there is complete fidelity to the scheme.  It them becomes predictable and systematic and progresses the learning rapidly for individual learners.  This is then the springboard for success with wider learning opportunities across the curriculum.
Hearing readers in the bottom 20%
Children in Year 1 and Year 2 at the early stages of fluency were observed reading to a familiar adult.  Children were reading books that matched their phonic phase of development.  Reading behaviours are developmental and the children were at different stages of acquiring phonics and fluency confidence.  The prognosis for all children is positive and it is clear to see the impact of the phonics programme on their progress.  The Year 2 children are likely to achieve success in the phonic screening test when they retake it.  Adults have been well trained to support readers acquire decoding and fluency skills.  Book talk skills were demonstrated at appropriate times to support recall, comprehension and prediction.  Children were encouraged to sound out and blend in their heads.  They could segment words and put them together.  Modelling of “my turn, your turn” was used at timely points.  Pronunciation was corrected when needed.  The more fluent the children were in their reading,  the more they were able to use the skills of prediction to help them make sense of the story.  They were also able to self-correct and increasingly able to use punctuation to support reading with expression.
Visits to the phonics sessions
Provision observed in the phonics sessions was strong and effective and there was rapid progress in learning during the snapshots observed.  This is because the school has some highly skilled expert teachers of phonics.  In Nursery children begin the Foundation programme for Little Wandle.  Songs and rhymes through video are used.  During this lesson children were identifying how many syllables there were in each word.  Actions were used to embed the learning where possible. Repetition was well used to reinforce and consolidate the learning.  Modelling was of high quality and children demonstrated confidence practising their sounds and accuracy in identifying sounds.  A blending activity took place using some magnetic letters and children demonstrated accuracy and competence in their sounding out of the sounds and words. The teaching sequence of revisit teach practice and apply the phonic sounds was explicit and children were highly engaged because the quality of teaching was of an exemplary standard and covered at a slick pace.  
High quality phonics teaching was similarly observed in reception led by skilled practitioners.  Pupils recapped prior leaning and practised blending words together.  Individual support was targeted enabling engagement.  Corrections were made appropriately and teaching assistant support was being used effectively to support the learning development.  Progression was clear as children were demonstrating success with chunking and blending longer words.  Children were able to rehearse and practice with their learning partners.  Some excellent modelling was observed which made the sounds explicit for the children.  There was clear confidence in the delivery and this is because teachers have such a strong level of subject knowledge.  Behaviour management was observed to be skilled and this enabled pace and progress to be rapid.
In the Year 1 class children were recapping their speedy sounds to test their recall of prior learning.  They were able to blend words accurately.  Tricky words were recapped and the new sound was introduced.  Clear connections between the grapheme and the phonemes were understood by the children.  The direct teaching was effective and progressed the learning.  There was not clarity in this part of the lesson relating to the role of the teaching assistant so this is worth revisiting to ensure consistency of approach across the school.

Visits to reading groups
Children in Year 2 were exploring the text “The Boastful Turtle”  and there was an inference focus to this lesson – a higher order reading skill.  The visualiser was used well to enable text analysis and children were being prompted to uplevel vocabulary.  There was careful targeting and support provided to children with individual needs and it was clear to see the skilful practical application of VIPERS (vocabulary, infer, predict, explain, retrieve, sequence, summarise) – the reading domains which support the development of pupils’ comprehension skills.
In Year 1 the impact of the work that has been completed with The English Hub can be clearly evidenced.  The reading sessions focus on decoding, prosody – reading with meaning stress and intonation and comprehension – and understanding the text. Energy could be observed in the reading groups.  Pupil groupings are targeted to support individual needs.  Correct sounds were modelled and questioning strategies were observed to be intuitive and effective.  There is a programme withing Little Wandle that progresses the learning of children with SEND.  Children are taught GPC (grapheme phoneme correspondence) in words sentences and decodable books.  (Graphemes are letters and letter combinations, phonemes are the speech sounds).  This was observed being delivered in a skilled and progressive manner in the Year 1 classroom.  We could see a consistent approach being used in the reading groups.  The correct terminology is being used by the staff.  Children demonstrate increasing confidence in blending strategies and children with more complex special needs are also enabled to access the programme to progress their reading skills. 

In summary
Exemplary progress is observed to have been made in response to this OFSTED key point for action.  The leaders and staff term deserve recognition for their commitment and determination to demonstrate high quality standards in this critical area of learning.  This visit demonstrated:
Reading has been the highest priority.  Embracing the guidance from The English Hub has made the difference.
There is an urgent, responsive approach if pupils start to fall behind in their phonic acquisition.  This is supported through the capacity, skilled and timely use of the Little Wandle tracking system. 
The weakest readers get effective support. This has been observed through the skilled delivery of the  SEND programme with staff who have been trained comprehensively to deliver this to a high standard.
Pupils read books that match the sounds they know. This means that pupils are learning to  read quickly with fluency.

Recommendations: 
Consider what reading related activities might be best for children to complete independently as part of the reading session when the adults are working with guided groups of children
Further develop the role of the teaching assistants in relation to supporting learning development to ensure consistency of approach across all classrooms.  You have strong practitioners for are valuable assets to the school.  Aim for consistency in approach for the maximum impact on learning.
Continue to develop parental engagement in the learning process for phonics and early reading.  You have many families who will want to engage and support their child’s learning and this is a further asset for the school.

Date and purpose of next visit: 19th March 2025

Phonics/reading | Fully adopt Little Wandle (LW) for phonics programme in Year 1. | To start after half term break | New members of staff and ECT | 68% YR1 children passed mock PSC March 24
75% YR1 children passed mock PSC April 24

75% YR1 are on track with phonics (LW Spring 2 Assessment)

75% of Reception on track with all aspects of LW
88% of Year 1 on track with all aspects of LW
(Summer 1 assessment)

91% YR1 children passed PSC
30% YR2 children passed PSC retake

See Heatmaps for Reception and Year 1 assessments.

Phonics/reading | Fully adopt LW for phonics programme in reception.
To concentrate on reading and not writing during phonics sessions for the short term, until LW has been adopted. | To start in the summer term.
To start asap. | Reception team | All children have started reading groups at start of summer 1. After each assessment point reading groups reviewed using LW tracker, all children either move up or remain at their current level.
Writing is part of the enhancements and modelled outside of phonics- 74% Reception are on track with writing- continued focus for summer term.
English Hub Action plans have been shared and put in place after Spring 1 and 2 visits- stating in Spring 2
“The school has made good progress in implementing the points since the last visit.” Teachers us the correct resources and weekly lesson plans to follow the structure”, Teachers use the correct language to encourage pupils to decode and then blend words.

Phonics/reading | Catch up sessions for pupils in Year 2 to use LW. | Asap but at least for after half term | AHT (Sarah) | Pupils in Year 2 not meeting reading expectations have been grouped in Phase 2, 3 and 5 phonics and reading groups to reduce the gap.
Teachers running groups for most catch up sessions.

Phonics/reading | New LW reading books to be circulated. | Asap but at least for after half term | HoS | Completed- no other books sent home and parents informed in writing and invited to a LW presentation. All reading books are matched to the child’s ability to read fluently.
English Hub Report Spring 1 and 2- “Staff use LW reading books to ensure reading books are closely matched to their ability to read tricky words and blending ability.”

Phonics/reading | Visit to Thomas Coram to discuss the reading curriculum with reading leader (Rebecca Monro) | Before half term. | AHT (Sarah) | Reading lessons changed to ensure consistency with Victoria and TC and using Reading Shed texts/lesson plans.
Lessons more targeted and reading skills explored following the updated Reading Framework- “comprehension is an outcome of reading lots, broadening vocabulary and developing knowledge. It is not something that can be taught in its own right. The reading approach in Year 2 develops children’s love of reading, automaticity and fluency, and consequently comprehension”

Phonics/reading | Clarify the reading curriculum. Year 1 teachers to implement. | To start after half term | Year 1 team | Children read twice a week -first session decode and second prosody/comprehension. Parent voice has been significant improvement in confidence of their children reading with fluency.

4
Do governors wish to consult in the next round of admissions?

It was agreed that governors do not wish to consult on admissions this year.

 
 

5
In Year admissions – decision on whether to continue with the Federation processing In-Year admissions or using Herts County Council (HCC)?

Currently the Federation manages the In-Year admissions process and BR advised that she felt this was the most effective system rather than using HCC.

Q – Are there any benefits to using HCC?
A – BR confirmed that using HCC offers no advantages; however, continuing with the current process provides benefits, including greater efficiency and faster admission of children

EB requested that CW upload the admission policies to the ‘Policies’ folder on Governor Hub.

It was agreed that the Federation would continue using their in-year admissions process.















CW
6
Consideration of pupil repeating a year – see document on Governor Hub

Governors confirmed that they had reviewed the letter from the parents and had considered the information provided.

BR confirmed that the Admissions Policy states that children should be educated in the correct chronological year group, with the curriculum differentiated accordingly, to meet their needs. This is in line with HCC’s policy and DfE guidance, which states that children should be educated in their normal age group.

LF advised governors that the parents had not made a formal request to the previous school for the child to repeat Nursery, however they had discussed the matter and agreed that the child would not repeat Nursery. The child does not have any physical difficulties and does not have any external agencies supporting him. He was seen by an Occupational Therapist (OT) however this report has not been shared by the parents. 

He does not have any formal diagnosis, and parents have discussed that they do not wish to pursue any further investigations into receiving a formal diagnosis and were satisfied with the Individual Learning Plan that has been developed by Victoria school.

BR informed governors that the class teacher and LF were confident that the child was accessing the curriculum effectively, however parents raised a concern about his social and emotional development, due to his experience at his previous school.

Q – What is the plan going forward, would he always remain out of his normal year group?
A – When he leaves Victoria, he could move straight to Year 4, not all schools would accommodate a child out of their normal year group. This has been explained to parents; however they are not concerned about this aspect of his future education and instead are more concerned with his current situation, they feel he is not ready for the transition into Year 1.

Q – How is the child progressing?
A - He is meeting 75% of the early learning objectives and has picked up reading very well, despite initially struggling to engage.

Q – How does that compare with his peers?
A – There are other children within the cohort that are not progressing as well as him. He is slightly below the national average, which is approximately 80%. 

BR informed governors that, unless there is compelling evidence from the class teacher, identifying additional special educational needs and specialist reports, recommending the child remain in Reception for a second year, the Federation would not recommend approving the request. LF added that, in summer 2024, there were children performing below his current level who have since transitioned to Year 1 and thrived. She also expressed concern that remaining in Reception and working alongside younger children could be more detrimental to his wellbeing.

Q – What has been communicated to parents? In their letter they refer to concerns being raised by the teacher.
A – His class teacher had mentioned that he is working slightly below the national average, at 75%, however she does not feel this warrants him remaining in Reception year for a second year. 

Q – The parents refer to a conversation regarding holding him back a year, when he first joined the school, could you elaborate.
A – During their initial tour of the school, prior to their child joining, the parents raised concerns and considered the option of him remaining in Nursery for an additional year. However, they decided to have the child join Reception as this was the most suitable course of action.

LF explained to the parents that any decision regarding a child repeating a year lies with the school and the governing body. She also emphasised that, without having worked with the child, it would be difficult to make an informed judgement at that stage. LF has since apologised for any initial confusion and confirmed that the child has settled in well, with no concerns raised by the class teacher or other staff that would support a recommendation for him to repeat a year.

Q – The parent implied that they believed an informal agreement had been reached, following your conversation. Did they follow up on this?  Did they submit a formal written request
A – The class teacher met with the parent to create an Individual Learning Plan for him, there was no formal request made to repeat Reception, parents were happy with the adjustments and interventions provided. 

LF informed governors that she had explained to the parents that they had the option to apply for Higher Needs Funding. However, the parents chose not to pursue this and reiterated their decision not to seek a formal diagnosis for their son, as they did not want him to feel different from other children.

Q – When is his birthday and are there other children comparable to him?
A – His birthday falls in June, and there are around 10 summer-born children in the cohort. While some summer-born pupils may require additional support, this is not the case for all. Children often develop significantly during Year 1, and by Year 2, they tend to progress at varying rates

Q – The parents referenced the DfE guidance, but I could not find any recommendation suggesting that repeating Reception would be beneficial. In fact, the guidance indicates that doing so could have a negative impact on the child, what do you think?
A – The DfE evidence relates to children starting Reception. The parents have expressed regret about not having their child repeat Nursery. However, LF and BR agree with the governors that the DfE does not strongly advocate for the repetition of Reception

EB explained that the parent believes moving to Year 1 would have a negative impact on their child’s social and emotional wellbeing. However, the DfE guidance EB reviewed does not support this view and, in fact, suggests the opposite. BR agreed that this is the opinion of the teachers working with the child. LF added that there are no external agencies involved, no EHCP in place, and the child has been thriving. She confirmed that he will continue to receive the same support and will have a smooth and well-supported transition

Q – Have you received any reports for external agencies such as the OT?
A – We understand from parents that there are currently no external agencies involved with the child and that the OT was completed in the previous school. Parents have offered to supply OT report and evidence from “educational professionals” but this evidence was not included with their letter to governors.

Q – What is the deadline to respond to parents?
A – We would like to respond as soon as possible as the transition period starts next week.

Q – I notice there is no right to appeal and this committee is classed as the admissions authority. I feel that we should review all the available evidence, prior to making our final decision. Could we ask for the OT report despite parents not being forthcoming with providing it?
A – BR agreed that reviewing the full report would reflect the governors’ due diligence and advised that it is important for making an informed decision. Given the tight timeframe, parents should be asked to submit the report by the end of the day tomorrow.

Governors requested that LF should ask parents for the report from the OT and any other external agencies. Governors and Senior Leaders will reconvene before the end of the week to consider all further evidence and reach a decision.

4 | Current pupils’ data -  Lisa Forde (LFo)
LFo advised governors that her presentation focused on reviewing the current Year 5 data, specifically looking at where the current Year 6 pupils were when they were in Year 5, in order to evaluate the impact of Pixl. The analysis highlighted some areas for improvement where additional support should be focused; however, overall, the impact has been very successful.

LFo clarified that pupils were assessed in weeks 4 and 5 of the autumn term, providing a baseline.
Blue indicates pupils are working at nearly greater depth or greater depth
Green indicates expected, nearly there, and those expected to achieve by the end of the year. 
‘B’ indicates pupils who are unlikely to meet the expected standard unless significant additional provision is put in place to support them.

LFo highlighted the following points:
Year 6 levels were low; therefore an additional teacher has been allocated to Year 6 to support them.
Reading has been significantly improved, with 40% of children at greater depth and 77% at expected, which is an excellent achievement at this time of the year.
Writing continues to be a concern across the school
The federation has subscribed to White Rose learning, which follows a concrete pictorial abstract approach allowing children to draw the problem, supporting problem-solving and reasoning, and provides additional challenge for more able learners.
Pupil progress meetings took place in October, during which teachers demonstrated a strong understanding of their pupils and their learning gaps, supported by the effective use of Pixl.

Q - Why is there discrepancy across the subjects?
A - Some teachers may be stronger at teaching reading, for example, however as a federation we are striving for high academic achievement, with an increased focus on supporting teachers. There is an improving picture in maths, but there is further work required. 

Q - How does the current Year 6 data compare with last year’s figures?
A – There is no significant difference

Q - What impact has the introduction of the new scheme had on teachers, and how confident are you that it will support improvement moving forward?
A – The White Rose scheme provides a high level of support for teachers, including videos, lesson plans and has been very well received by teachers.

Q: What could prevent you from achieving this improvement?
A: Teachers can sometimes feel constrained by the curriculum, so it is important to allow time for flexibility. We encourage teachers to be creative and to inspire pupils.


Governors agreed that the data was insightful, highlighting key gaps, and supported the implementation of a new scheme.

5 | Curriculum update 
SEND Ordinary Provision

TC
LD highlighted the key focus areas:
White Rose introduced for Maths
Herts Essentials
Teachers have been coached through joint teaching and peer observation, which has been a valuable exercise, enabling them to take ideas back to their classrooms and implement them.
Learning walks have been conducted across the school and general feedback has been provided to the whole school, supporting staff CPD.

Q: Will the learning walk observations be included in appraisals?
A: Observations provide useful feedback, though no formal feedback was planned. Any issues were addressed with teachers, and as targets were set in September aligned to the School Improvement Plan, the observations may not directly affect them.

Victoria
LF highlighted the following key areas of focus:
Focus on building strong foundations in reading, writing, and maths.
Essentials Writing has been embedded in Years 1 and 2 and is now being rolled out in Early Years. The Early Years adviser praised the exceptional mark-making and suggested sharing it with other settings.
Significant contribution from an ECT, with “tool of the week” initiatives (e.g., gel pens, highlighters) creating excitement and engagement.
Emphasis on handwriting and number recognition. Book looks to identify issues and following a review with LF, teachers have implemented creative approaches focusing on quality over quantity to improve outcomes.
History curriculum will move to Kapow after Christmas.
LF and BR reviewed books of vulnerable children, gaining valuable insights. LF is compiling a list of key concepts for specific staff to check a pupils’ understanding.

SEND Ordinary Provision
BR confirmed that the Herts SEN team produced a comprehensive document. It includes a definition of Ordinary Provision, which the school is meeting with no concerns; it also provides helpful links to the toolkit.

Governors asked whether a succession plan is in place for the SENDCo. BR explained that a teacher is currently undertaking the SENDCo qualification as part of her CPD; should a vacancy arise, she would then be able to apply for the role.

6 | SEA visit report
The visit was cancelled by the SEA at Victoria and the report from the visit to Thomas Coram has not yet been received.

7 | Update on reading, phonics knowledge and language comprehension  

LF advised governors:
Graduated phonics and Little Wandle continue to be implemented, with two further monitoring visits planned. 
Phonics and reading groups are tracked regularly, and additional in-class phonics interventions are in place where needed.
All but one child in Reception are reading banded books. 
In Year 1, 75% of pupils are currently at the expected level for reading.

Governors acknowledged the strong progress being made. When asked about higher-attaining pupils, it was reported that approximately eight pupils in Year 2 are currently working at greater depth. These pupils transitioned directly from Little Wandle in Year 1 to banded books. By the end of the previous academic year, 40% of pupils were assessed as working at greater depth.

8 | Pupil Premium strategy for website - update

BR advised governors that VIP training has been undertaken with HfL, with significant work focused on refining the language used in the statement, across the federation. Lucy, Lisa and BR are currently fine-tuning the Pupil Premium strategy with a strong emphasis on supporting all of the  the most vulnerable pupils. The schools are two of 21 participating in the VIP pilot, which includes weekly meetings with individual pupils and a clearer academic focus.

Q: Do the children wear a badge to identify them as VIPs?
A: The children at TC requested badges; while these are not currently available at Victoria, due to the age of the child, pupils wear their VIP badges with pride at TC.

9 | Outcome of monitoring activities – classroom visits

Governors agreed that this point had been covered earlier in the discussion.

10 | Link visit reports
ID confirmed that he has observed all the areas discussed by LF in the above minutes. He also noted that the planned English visit will be rescheduled due to recent staffing changes.

SH and LPr carried out a joint Maths visit as part of the handover process; however, the notes are currently in draft form and will be shared once the teacher has had the opportunity to review them.

NB-W gave an in-depth report at the FGB, where she stated that she was impressed with the level of Church Distinctiveness being carried out.

11 | Pupil Council/ Eco/Spiritual ambassadors  Leaders advised governors that:
The Pupil Parliament raised £106 through the sale of pre-loved Christmas jumpers.
The Spiritual Ambassadors have been working closely with Father Stuart and lead a collective worship each term, for example Harvest in the autumn term and the Parable of the Prodigal Son in the spring term.
As part of Kindness at Victoria, a Year 2 pupil submitted a successful bid for £150, which generated great excitement. This funding has supported the creation of a kindness stop in the playground and the purchase of high-visibility jackets for Kindness Ambassadors, linked to the 52 Lives initiative. Pupils also visited the food bank, which was a highly engaging experience.

12 | Pupil Surveys
BR advised that the overall feedback was very positive, with 100% of pupils stating that they are kind to others.

One concern raised by governors was that 15% of pupils in Year 1 reported that they do not feel safe. LF advised that they felt this may relate to their understanding of the question or the language used and is something she will be following up.

Governors queried why 21% of children stated that they cannot attend a range of clubs, either because they are unable to access one or feel that suitable options are not available. LD advised that a recurring theme was interest in construction-based activities, such as a Lego club, which is being considered. It was also noted that a significant number of pupils with SEN currently attend clubs.

13 | Policies/Guidance for review include (on Gov Hub):

Governors approved the following policies:
Behaviour Policy
RE Policy
Supporting Children with Medical Conditions
Governors queried how supply teachers are made aware of an IHCP, BR confirmed this forms part of a handover with a staff member, adding that the office manage the short or long term medication, maintaining consistency. All plans are on medical tracker. EB stated that there are some variations in font colour that should be updated by CW prior to being uploaded to the website.

3 | Actions from meeting
CW to upload Terms of Reference onto Governor Hub by 20/09/25 - completed
Clearer signposting of training platforms and relevant training sessions for governors by BR for next FGB – BR shared her screen to show NGA’s website and signposted governors to a range of training modules, advising governors to click on learning link then learning. 

Q: It would be helpful to know which training platform to use for specific topics—for example, whether to choose NGA or Modern Governor.

A: Governors should not feel limited to a single platform; the choice depends on personal preference. 

Governors also suggested that providing a simple guide to the available platforms as part of the induction would be useful.

Review training needs for governors at next FGB – see point 6
All governors to upload their action plans into the Strategy Session/2025 folder on Governor Hub, or email it to EB who will upload it – see point 6

6 | Skills audit
Review governor training
EB advised that following a review of the Skills Audit there were some key areas of training highlighted:

Finance and budgets
SEND
Data Analysis
Cyber Security

EB asked SH to share any available training sessions with governors.

EB has been reviewing governors’ personal action plans and linking them with the Federation’s 5 Year plan, with a view to improve governor effectiveness. EB will circulate targets to individual governors and requested feedback following their review. | SH











All governors

7 | Governor subscriptions review
EB highlighted the subscriptions governors could access:

HfL
Governor Hub
NGA

8 | Review Governor Induction pack
EB asked CC and LPr for feedback on the induction pack.

CC explained that she initially found the experience quite overwhelming, as she had no prior involvement with schools and was unfamiliar with many aspects.
LPr commented that she found it clear and helpful, however she highlighted that working in education was a distinct advantage.

EB requested that any feedback or suggestions for improvement be shared with her directly, following the reflections from CC and LPr. | CC and LPr

9 | Safeguarding

• Safeguarding practice reports
ID met with LD and LF and was confident that the safeguarding processes were effective. ID also met with TR and felt that the SCR was being managed appropriately.
BR thanked LD and LF for their extensive work in producing the reports and to ID for his support.
ID confirmed that Governor safeguarding training is up to date.

• Filtering and monitoring update
BR confirmed that a monitoring system, Classroom Cloud, has been purchased for Upper KS2. It provides improved analysis and flags specific search terms.

Governors agreed that it was a valuable system.

10 | Governor Visit report feedback	
NB-W shared her report following her visit to review Church Distinctiveness. She highlighted that:
She met with BR, LD, and LF and thanked them for their support during the visit.
She observed weekly collective worship and visited three classrooms, where every child was engaged and focused.
The school’s vision and values are clearly understood by the whole community, and the parable of the mustard seed is effectively used to support this understanding.
The school displays a biblical timeline and mural, and the RE curriculum now includes a rigorous assessment module. The federation is also developing its approach to understanding spirituality.
At V, NB-W met with the spiritual ambassadors, all of whom said they wanted to demonstrate kindness in their role, with one adding that they wanted to show Jesus’ love.
NB-W concluded that it was a very positive visit and that Church Distinctiveness is clearly embedded across the school.

ID advised that he has conducted his Reading and Writing visit with LF and LD and will produce the report during the next couple of weeks.

Governors agreed that their visits had been booked in. EB reminded governors that their report should be shared with teachers prior to the report being published on Governor Hub.

LPr confirmed that a joint visit with SH is planned as part of the transition of maths to LPr.

11 | Annual update on how equality objectives are being met by the federation (DEI statement on Gov Hub)
BR informed governors that further work will be undertaken on the equality objectives, and a draft will be shared with governors after Christmas. BR also confirmed that no additional changes are needed to the DEI statement.

12 | Executive Headteacher’s Report (including FIP RAG rating and three-year oracy plan)

BR provided an overview for Governors:
Oracy objectives on the FIP are being slightly amended. An interim three-year oracy plan is in place, with the intention of adopting the full oracy programme next year.
Inclusion of the most vulnerable children remains a significant focus for the Federation. Work has progressed quickly to embed this approach across both schools, developing the philosophy behind it, strengthening relationships, and ensuring vulnerable pupils feel a sense of belonging—identified as fundamental. This work was deemed essential even before its increased prominence in the Ofsted framework.

Q: What are the implications of the changes to TA and LSA roles in terms of pay banding, staff views, and budget impact?
A: No concerns have been raised and the increased cost was included in the budget. It was considered morally right to ensure equality of pay and consistent treatment across all staff. Governors agreed that this was very important.

Q: Regarding maternity cover and successful candidates appointed—Is there scope to retain these staff? Were they recruited through an agency?
A: Retention can be considered if suitable vacancies arise, and this presents a positive opportunity to secure high-quality staff. One candidate was recruited through an agency.

Q: The Every Child Programme includes 71 pupils (VIPs), which seems high—are only TAs involved?
A: LD confirmed that considerable time was taken to allocate pupils to staff. Twenty-seven staff members volunteered, including office staff, TAs, and teachers. Meetings take place during break times, lunchtimes, and soft starts. The programme is working well, and LD proposed that a staff voice would be conducted to obtain further feedback on the success. Staff have specific focus areas to cover with their allocated pupils.
Governors noted that this is a very rewarding role and agreed that the programme provides strong support for VIP pupils.


Heads of school’s report

Thomas Coram
LD advised that the format of the report was changed in line with Ofsted criteria. Governors agreed it was a very clear and concise report and found the new format very easy to access. 

LD has introduced peer coaching with a structured plan over the year to include peer observations. LD informed governors that this has led to extensive learning walks where significant improvements in the teaching and learning have been evidenced.

LD clarified that the Year 3–6 baseline assessment data indicated low writing outcomes; however, this reflects the fact that some content has not yet been taught. It is therefore expected that writing achievement will be higher by the end of the year.

LD informed governors that a recent pupil survey showed that 100% of respondents reported feeling proud to be part of Team TC, which Governors agreed was a very positive outcome. 


Victoria Head’s report

LF informed governors that a key priority is embedding an inclusion thread across the curriculum and carrying out significant work with VIPs. Considerable work is also taking place on developing core skills, particularly early reading and writing. LF and BR have spent substantial time evaluating progress across the school.

Governors agreed to focus on how their link subject is celebrated and validated during their visits to aid their review.

IDSR – (on Gov Hub - you need to download to access the weblink)

This provides an overview of the school including areas such as the profile and outcomes, which provides governors with a vital analysis of the school. The Federation SEA will support governors using this tool during a training session in January, where the focus will be reviewing Victoria’s IDSR. Any specific questions governors would like to address in the training session should be emailed to LF and BR by 7th January.

Governors queried the following acronyms:

CIN – Child in Need
FSM6 – Free School Meal Ever 6
EAL – English Additional Language
ACE – Adverse Childhood Experience – BR added that across the federation, VIPs are graded according to the number of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) they have encountered, such as family separation, parental substance misuse, or exposure to domestic violence

TC’s SIAMS self-evaluation document 
LD informed governors that Lisa from the Diocese conducted a SIAMS review in the summer. Following her feedback, the school’s approach has been updated, and this work is continuing.
.

13 | Pupil numbers in Berkhamsted 
Victoria meeting with planning team 
Planning team discussion at local HT’s meeting

BR informed governors that Hertfordshire, and Berkhamsted in particular, have been affected by a falling birth rate, resulting in increased competition between schools for pupil places. Significant work has taken place at Victoria, including enhanced school tours, and numbers have improved, with 30 pupils now in Nursery compared to 17 last year. This, governors agreed reflects a strong approach,
.
LF was contacted by the planning team regarding a review of pupil numbers, which BR also attended. The planning team is assessing projections and considering whether Victoria and another local school may need to move from two-form to one-form entry. This would also impact Thomas Coram, with a possible change to two form entry. BR has spoken with the Diocesan Admissions Officer, Maggie, and SEA, providing a rationale for why a reduction in PAN is not currently necessary. Any change to PAN would require an 18-month consultation.

The planning team attended the BASH meeting and reiterated that all schools in Berkhamsted need to consider solutions. If no school volunteers to reduce its PAN, the council may be required to impose changes.

The planning team have since apologised for their initial approach and confirmed that they will continue discussions with all Berkhamsted schools. LF, LD, TT, EB and BR will meet the planning team and report back to governors.

Governors thanked BR for her hard work on this matter.

14 | GDPR update 
BR reminded governors that the federation has moved to HFL for GDPR and DPO support. TR has met with the DPO, and several updates to documentation are required. CW was thanked for supporting TR with these updates.
.

15 | Website compliance
LF and LD have been carefully reviewing the website to ensure all information is up to date. Only minor adjustments were needed.
Governors agreed that this reflects the school’s effectiveness in maintaining compliance.

16 | Investment update
TT reported that £41,000 is held by the Diocese, for TC with a further £12,500 transferred to the Diocese recently. BR and TT met with the investment advisers, who recommended placing the funds in low-risk bonds, in line with the current investment of the £41,000 held by the Diocese in the school’s name. Governors agreed with the investment recommendation.

TT also informed governors that a further £2,500 is held in the names of the two priests personally. TT has passed the necessary paperwork to them, and they will need to liaise with the current investment provider to complete the required documentation. This is expected to be a lengthy process.

Governors thanked TT for his support and the time he has dedicated to progressing this matter.

17 | Policies/Guidance for review include (on Gov Hub):

Lettings Policy: EB advised governors that the lettings fees have been updated and an evacuation plan added.
Governors queried whether a clause should be included to exclude liability for loss of injury. BR agreed to clarify whether any hirers use the HCC insurance as any clause would need to also reflect this. 

Q – Who needs to read this policy?
A – While the federation does not usually hire the premises for one off lettings, any hirer would be required to read this policy prior to hiring the premises.

Q – The hiring costs have increased during weekends and school holiday hirings except the playground at Victoria, is there a reason for this?
A – The playground is rarely hired out, so it felt appropriate to keep it the same.

Code of Conduct – parents, carers and visitors replaced by the new Disruptive Behaviour policy 
The previous Code of Conduct for Parents, Carers and Visitors has been replaced by the new Disruptive Behaviour Policy. BR explained that she has used this policy before and developed it with the HCC legal team, ensuring it reflects current harassment legislation. She advised that it is a very robust document and recommended that governors adopt it. The policy addresses issues such as harassment and intimidation.

Governors discussed the section relating to derogatory comments on social media. They considered how to achieve the right balance, recognising that stakeholders should be free to comment about the school and to raise appropriate challenge, while also defining what constitutes inappropriate or harmful criticism.

BR noted that if a parent was overtly critical LF, LD and BR would always seek to approach the parent directly to resolve matters. HCC has been clear that schools should not be subject to unreasonable or abusive criticism

TT expressed concern about how the policy balances this with freedom of speech.
NB-W commented that the degree of criticism, including both content and frequency, must be considered. BR added that issues also arise when a parent is critical of staff members on platforms such as WhatsApp, Governors agreed this was unacceptable.

BR agreed to review this point and the policy will be reviewed again at the next FGB meeting.

EB requested that CW update the numbering on the policy and remove the requirement for the COG to sign the document.

Attendance Policy 

EB confirmed the only change was to LD’s surname. 

It was noted by governors that there was no reference to the rule requiring children to remain off school for 48 hours after being sick. It was suggested that this should be included.BR agreed to review this, Governors were happy to approve the current policy.

Attendance Policy V: No changes

Governors approved the policy for Thomas Coram and Victoria.

Prevent Policy:  Governors approved the policy

Pay Policy
Q – Point 5.1 Pay Progression does not mention that if a staff member was on capability proceedings their pay may not progress. It is included under 3.1, governors agreed it should be included under 5.1 as well to ensure the impact of being on capability was clear.

BR clarified that this is a model policy and whilst areas such as time scales relating to appeals was not included, it adheres to the ‘Green Book’ conditions and should therefore not be amended.

Governors approved the policy.

Health and Attendance Policy – Governors approved the policy

Publication Scheme: EB clarified the scheme name had been updated to Freedom of Information - Governors approved the policy

Data Protection Policy: EB confirmed the DPO name had changed, but not further amendments were made - Governors approved the policy

CCTV Policy – Governors approved the policy | BR

2 | Reflection on last year and previous goals.
EB welcomed CC and LPr and thanked everyone for their commitment and emphasised the importance of the school’s culture in supporting the Federation.

Governors agreed that the excellent results from both schools should be celebrated, as they reflect the dedication of staff. In addition, Victoria have been invited to be a Champion School by Little Wandle which is excellent achievement. 

Governors acknowledged strong recruitment, noting only one Governor vacancy remains and that the board has a broad and robust skill set.

Review of last year’s priorities for Governors
Governors reviewed last year’s priorities and agreed:
Communication strategy: working group has been very effective and it was agreed the committee members would remain the same for 25-26 (MV, MT, ID and TT) although TT has now stepped back from this committee!
Governor visits effectiveness: significant work has led to more effective visits, with most staff providing positive feedback. It was agreed that further refinements are needed, including clearly identifying visit objectives for governors and supporting them to understand how best to achieve those objectives
Training: SH has championed governor development, ensuring everyone is up to date with recommended training. Moving forward BR and EB proposed governors could utilise the learning links on the NGA and governors agreed they would benefit from BR signposting specific areas.
Church Distinctiveness: Christian identity strengthened including commissioning and installing two new murals.
MV highlighted that TC had achieved a distinction in Green Schools which governors agreed is an excellent achievement.

4 | School’s priorities for the year ahead

Victoria achievements and priorities of School Improvement Plan (SIP) 
Governors congratulated LF on the following achievements at Victoria last year:
Becoming of champion of Little Wandle – LF stated the success would not happen without an effective team
Successful collaborative working across both schools for subject leaders
Effective implementation of Kindness and Spiritual Ambassadors
The Stay and Play initiative was successful, leading to increased nursery admissions. In addition, a grant was secured to improve the provision.

LF shared the following SIP Priorities with governors:
1 Foundation Subject Assessments – used effectively to ensure children can retain and retrieve core knowledge – children should demonstrate articulate learning as they progress through the school
2 Oracy across the curriculum – developing skills from Nursery and Reception where some pupils have struggled with communication skills by supporting children to become confident speakers with oracy playing a key role.
3 Writing fluency – developing strong foundations using the early writing framework, understanding how to support pupils, including developing fine motor skills

Q – Do we have access to a Speech and Language (S&L) therapist and do staff have any S&L training?
A – There are various accessible programmes, staff have not had specific S&L training. The initial step is to conduct an audit to assess and identify needs

Q – Why are we seeing increasing challenges with communication skills?
A – Research indicates that the growing use of mobile devices is having an effect on fundamental communication skills, making it vital to tackle this in the Early Years to lessen the impact.

Q – Are parents supported in reading with their children?
A – Yesterday a PowerPoint was presented to parents, explaining when to read to children and how to listen to them read, this received positive feedback from parents.

Q – What are the outcome measures for priority 1?
A – Working in collaboration with the assessment team at Hertfordshire to develop knowledge organisers and teacher activities, including targeted questioning to assess children’s learning (e.g., identifying how many children can recall and explain five key facts about a topic). Learning is measured both during and after activities. In addition, partnered with a Herts Teaching and Learning Adviser to support a specific teacher in driving the curriculum and to work with ECTs to strengthen assessment practice.

Q – Are parents aware of what the children are learning so they could support their understanding at home?
A – A curriculum letter is sent home each term outlining the areas of learning to be covered.

Q – Regarding priority 2, are there any smart goals for assessing effectiveness?
A – An initial audit must be completed to identify specific criteria for a working group to consider. Smart goals will be agreed following this assessment.


TC achievements and priorities of School Improvement Plan (SIP) 

LD was congratulated by the Governors on the following successes at TC last year:
Fantastic SATS results, all above national and Hertfordshire averages. Governors agreed the additional teacher in Year 6 for Maths and English contributed towards the success, this has now been expanded to Year 5
Excellent Multiplication check results with an increasing two-year trend
The new writing scheme introduced in January has boosted teacher confidence and strengthened children’s ownership of their writing
The introduction of Pixl assessments in Years 3-6 has supported child development
Year 6 successfully raised £800 via their enterprise activities

LD advised governors that SIP priorities 1 and 2 are the same as Victoria’s.
Priority 3 -The aim is to improve children’s accuracy in key mathematical knowledge to strengthen reasoning and understanding. With support from the new Maths Co-ordinator the first step will be to identify strong areas and development needs via a learning walk.

Q – After reviewing maths, how will you measure progress?
A – Monitoring key priorities within lessons, such as the use of concrete resources, establishing guidelines for a working wall, and benefiting from continued guidance from the Herts Teaching and Learning Adviser.

Q – When you talk about accuracy can we benchmark against other schools nationally and locally?
A – As accuracy relates to knowledge of key number facts, external comparisons are limited, so attention is directed towards consistency throughout the school

Q Can you explain assessments in writing?
A Due to low writing attainment across the school, moderation was carried out in the Spring and Summer terms. Prescriptive outcomes have been set for each child. Whole-school assessment will include children writing a letter to their teacher to assess key aspects of their writing.

Exec Head’s Review of Federation Improvement Plan (FIP) priorities 
BR shared a summary of the key priorities of the FIP with governors:

Priority 1 – Building on existing practice to develop the following four pillars:
Educational Excellence
Happiness
Berkhamsted Community
Sustainability

Priority 2 - Accelerating pupil progress by creating equity for the vulnerable pupils (VIP’s) across the Federation
Shifting staff mindset to ensure vulnerable children (VIP’s) have access to necessary resources
The Federation will be working with 21 schools across Hertfordshire working on supporting the VIP’s which includes allocating a specific adult to each vulnerable child.
Using a spreadsheet developed by Hertfordshire County Council to identify key areas of vulnerability and providing bespoke support to enable them to move forward
Developing a consistent approach across the Federation, to support children returning from an absence, ensuring they feel valued and missed, supporting a sense of belonging

Priority 3 Distinctive Christian Character
Forming a working group to review all aspects of Christian Distinctiveness - monitoring whole school collective worship and asking governors to be involved in assessing this.

Priority 4 - Careers programme across the federation
Supporting pupils to gain an understanding of potential future careers from EY to Year 6

2024-25 Achievements across the Federation
Extensive work on embedding the school’s vision and values with children, supporting all pupils to articulate them confidently.
Significant development of the RE curriculum and collective worship.
Creation of a robust 5-year strategic plan.
Enhancement of appraisal processes to ensure accountability for all staff.
Strong pupil outcomes across both schools.
Reviewed financial allocation to provide additional interventions and small-group support.
Effective marketing initiatives, particularly at Victoria.

Governors agreed the FIP was robust and contained SMART deliverables.


Q – VIP’s formal assessments and diagnosis can be challenging to obtain, how is the Federation supporting children with suspected conditions?
A -  Prior to formal diagnosis the SENDCo will be involved with the child, supporting them with interventions. All classes have consistent resources, for example all classes are dyslexia friendly.

Ofsted update training

To keep governors informed, LD agreed to share four recent Ofsted updates. BR highlighted the importance of governors understanding their role within the Federation, which included an in-depth understanding of Ofsted expectations.

5 | Round table discussion on school priorities and alignment of governing board priorities:

Governors split into small groups to discuss the following areas and agreed the following:

Are they the right priorities
Governors believe the highlighted priorities effectively support the development of the Federation. Having contributed to these priorities, they consider them well-aligned, balancing educational objectives with appropriate challenge to drive ongoing improvement across the Federation.

How can we as governors support the schools in achieving their goals

Governors are assigned to specific areas of the 5-year plan, with ongoing visits supporting continued progress toward these goals.

What should our goals as a governing board be:

Ofsted training to identify key focusses for governors
Year 1 priorities of the strategic plan will be a major focus, with all governors assigned specific roles to support its implementation
Refining Governor visit structure to ensure they are effective
Succession planning including ongoing training, ensuring roles are filled to support continuity


d. Success criteria

Governors agreed to review the success criteria for their goals at the next FGB meeting.

6 | Personal planning exercise

Each governor created a governor personal action plan detailing how they will support the governing board and school priorities.

7 | Each governor to present back their personal action plan highlighting their goals and priorities for the year ahead:

Governors agreed the following personal actions:
MV – Marketing: continue sustaining progress and long-term sustainability, driving successful admission numbers at Victoria. Admissions: Receive training to support processes. Pupil and staff discipline: Monitor systems to ensure effectiveness. Complaints: Manage in a sensitive and professional manner.
ID – Safeguarding: Acting as new safeguarding lead; to receive support from LD and LF and complete governor safeguarding training within the first term. Meet with DSLs across the federation. Curriculum: Validate implementation of new phonics and writing schemes, meet termly with literacy leads in both schools to deepen understanding. Marketing: Participate in the marketing committee to develop skills in publishing and data analysis
SO – Collective worship: Continue embedding work and invest additional time, following last year’s sabbatical. Stuart left at 9pm
NB-W – School understanding: Build knowledge following time spent with SENDCo’s; observe provision for EHCPs and review how schools meet pupil needs. Review staff training scope and provisions. Leadership: Shadow KH to take over P&C Chair. Classroom links: Review consistency of learning and vocabulary teaching. As Foundation Governor support the school’s Christian Distinctiveness, potentially strengthening links with Sunnyside Church.

MT – Marketing: Support SLT using newsletters and the church community; consider training in school marketing
CC – School visits: Aim to visit the school weekly to gain insight, linked to a class so teachers feel supported. Suggested activities include assemblies, small groups at lunchtime, collective worship, and learning walks. Follow-up via email to arrange visits 

TB, KH, SH, and TT - Absent

Governors agreed it was a valuable exercise and provided an opportunity to focus on their own development.

8 | Group discussion on the individual action plans

Are they aligned to the school and governing board priorities? 
Governors agreed their priorities are aligned to the school priorities in the schools’ SIP’s and FIP.
Are they sufficiently clear and with tangible actions? 
Governors reviewed initial actions and agreed they would evolve during the year.
c. Do they cover what we need to deliver or are there any gaps? 
There are gaps in governor support which are: GDPR and Health and Safety.
d. Are there any places where we need to collaborate in a more structured way (e.g. by forming sub-committees)?
No sub-committees were agreed by the governors
Are there places where we collectively need more support (e.g. any group training requirements)?
Governors highlighted training needs concerning the new Ofsted requirements is essential to ensure governors understand their priorities.

9 | Conclusions 

Governors agreed they their priorities were aligned with the Federation and they felt better equipped to support the school having now reflected on them.

3 | Matters arising:

BR to change ‘performance management of governors’ in annual plan of works to ‘one-to-ones’ - completed
TT to add an additional point regarding wellbeing onto the risk register by next Resources meeting- completed see point 8
TT to contact Diocese and agree a meeting with their financial officers to review the M&G fund and report back at next Resources meeting –  TT advised an online investment meeting has been arranged for 18th November with the advisors recommended by the Diocese. The Diocese currently holds £41,000 in the Governors’ name and is helping to determine how these funds can be accessed and which school they relate to. Additionally, there is £2,500 held with Aviva under the names of two priests, which TT may need to transfer into his own name in order to access the funds. TT will continue to advise Governors as the matter progresses
MV and TB to do grievance training, as a priority, in case they are required to attend a probationary hearing – MV and TB have completed Disciplinary training, Governance have confirmed there is no specific training on a disciplinary/probation hearing 
BR to consider a gate risk assessment, with the support of AB, if required and feedback at next Resources meeting – this has been uploaded to Governor Hub, no further comments made and AB thanked for his support | TT

4 | HR

Confirmation of staff performance appraisal process and consideration of recommendations for pay reviews, including UPS applications

All staff appraisals have been completed. BR shared anonymised appraisal documentation. Staff highlighted in yellow are already at the top of their pay scale; those highlighted in green are recommended for progression.

Q: Were there any conflicting comments from staff?
A: No. As part of the review process, all staff were offered professional development opportunities and access to mental health support, reinforcing that they are valued members of the school community.

Q: What type of responses are typically received regarding mental health support?
A: Most staff decline support, but they are encouraged to return if their circumstances change. A robust referral system is in place.

Q: Why are some staff both at the top of scale and recorded as ‘partially met’?
A: There are no significant concerns with individual staff performance. In these cases, mid-cycle role changes meant original targets could not be fully met.

Governors approved the proposed scale-point increases for those highlighted in green, confirming these costs are within budget.

BR confirmed that no UPS applications were submitted this cycle.



Early Career Teacher support 
LF reported that two ECTs remain at Victoria. One is due to complete their induction by Christmas. Both are proactive in seeking advice, accessing support, and visiting other schools to enhance their practice. Both are on track with no concerns. There are currently no ECTs at TC. Governors agreed that this was an excellent outcome.

Staffing updates 
Maternity cover appointments have been made at Victoria; three strong candidates have been secured. A comparison between agency costs and direct employment was carried out as part of the recruitment process, and the difference in cost was minimal. Governors agreed that in the current education recruitment crisis, this was a very positive outcome.

At TC, a one-to-one support staff member has been appointed who will work across both Victoria and TC.

•  Staff Absence and Trends 2024–25
Absence data can only be produced on a February-to-February basis. Governors reviewed data and queried the following points:

Q: Why is Victoria’s average absence higher than TC’s?
A: Victoria has a smaller workforce, so individual absences have a greater proportional impact. Return-to-work meetings and Occupational Health referrals are completed where appropriate.

Q: Is there a trend in mental health-related absence?
A: Issues are predominantly individual and linked to external factors rather than workplace pressures. The current pattern remains consistent with previous data.

Q: Are any incentives offered for 100% attendance—for example, time off in lieu?
A: BR will review potential incentives, as this may have a positive impact.

Governors agreed that whilst a review of the information was very useful, updated data should be reviewed in the summer term, as the current dataset is nine months old.

BR also noted that sickness insurance schemes are in place and that payments will be received for eligible absence claims. These payments do not yet appear in the budget monitor, as the exact amounts have not been confirmed. | LP/BR

5 | Finance
P6 Monitor 
Governors reviewed the monitor and questions were invited.

Q: At TC there is £13,000 of SEN income that has not been received. What is the reason for this?
A: One child was incorrectly banded and another has left, resulting in the shortfall.

Q: Agency supply costs at TC have increased by £17,000. What has caused this? Is the phasing correct and is all of this budgeted to be spent in Period 12?
A: Unexpected absences have resulted in an increase in supply costs. The associated cost has been allocated across the year rather than being concentrated in Period 12.
Q: There are three new staff appointed to the ASC at Victoria. Is there additional income to support this?
A: Additional revenue is expected, but we have taken a prudent approach. Increased sickness levels and the appointment of a manager have resulted in higher expenditure. An additional staff member has been recruited to ensure consistent cover during absences and while this will not generate additional revenue, it ensures a reliable service for parents.

6 | SFVS Audit Update
LP advised governors that an online meeting is planned with the auditor on 24th November. LP will provide feedback at the next Resources meeting, | LP

7 | Health and Safety update
The quinquennial report for Victoria has been completed, at a cost of £4,500, which has highlighted a number of actions. Health & Safety inspections are scheduled for 21st and 28th November.

Q: Has the report highlighted a higher volume of actions than expected?
A: The report informs bids for work to enable schools to request funding from the Diocese. Approximately 90% of the identified work is decorative or superficial. Items classified as D1 are currently being costed, as these are a higher priority. 

BR confirmed that actions arising from the report are being addressed and will be shared with MT, who will provide feedback in the next Resources meeting.

In addition, fire safety audits have been completed at both schools. Following the audits eight staff members have completed fire warden training. | MT

8 | Risk Register
Governors approved the updated risk register, following an addition of a wellbeing statement.

9 | Policies/Guidance for review include (on Gov Hub):

Governors approved the following policies and acknowledged that a new Safer Recruitment Policy will be reviewed when issued by HfL:

Appraisal Policy 
Safer Recruitment Policy 
Nursery admissions policy 
Nursery SIF

10 | AOB
Approval of budget for staff Christmas lunch, staff cards and gifts
Governors approved the governors account covering the cost associated with the staff Christmas lunch, staff Christmas cards and gifts

Newsletter
MT will be creating the governor newsletter and asking for contributions towards this.


Climate Action Plan
Governors thanked AB for their hard work and  agreed that the plan should be  revised following the training course in January. BR recommended producing a Federation document with dedicated sections for TC and V.

Victoria Allotment
MV has arranged for a donation of tools for the allotment. AB volunteered to support the development of the allotment for 2026. Both Governors were thanked for their contribution. | All

Consideration of pupil repeating a year – see document on Governor Hub – Continuation of consideration process started 16.06.25

Governors reviewed the notes of the Occupational Therapist (OT) report dated 27/2/25 and agreed that the content of those notes had not persuaded governors that the child repeating Reception year was in his best interests.

BR confirmed that the child’s teacher does not feel him repeating Reception year would be the best option for him. BR believes that it could be detrimental to his social and emotional wellbeing than transitioning into year 1 with his peers.  She added that the class teacher had confirmed that there was nothing contained within the notes of the OT report, in terms of interventions and support, that could not be offered to the child in year 1. 

LF said that there would be additional transition arrangements and support put in place for him, to ensure that his introduction to year 1 was the best possible experience.

SO observed that the impact on the child’s social and emotional wellbeing of being held back a year could have a disadvantageous effect, as this would be the third set of peers in a year. As the concern is over his social and emotional wellbeing, as well as his academic achievement, staying with his friends that he has made in Reception would be the best support for him.  

Governors unanimously decided that the child will benefit most from transitioning into year 1 rather than repeating Reception, and that the parents should be informed at the earliest opportunity of this decision.

It was decided that a letter confirming this decision should be sent out before the end of Friday 20th June 2025.

5 | Finance (documents on Governor Hub)
Budget vs actual to date 
Confirm audit of private fund and governor fund and actions
Letting income
Schedule of Financial Delegation
P5 Monitors
Review M&G trust monies Victoria

LP invited questions on the various financial reports.

Bank Accounts
Q - Governors noted that the bank account balances are lower than in the previous year and requested clarification.
A - It was confirmed that the figures represent a snapshot taken on a specific day. The school’s RAG rating is green, and the monitoring report provides a more accurate reflection of the overall financial position.

Decorating Costs
Q - Governors queried the absence of decorating expenditure in the budget.
A - It was confirmed that the costs were covered from the TC Fund account rather than the main school budget.

Governor Account Balance
Q - Governors observed that the Governor account balance has been increasing year on year and asked whether the funds are earmarked.
A - The funds are increasing as the investment returns are currently higher than governor expenditure. The funds are not earmarked and are available for use – any proposals are very welcome. It was however noted that the investment funds are currently held in the names of two priests. The Finance Governor is investigating options to transfer the funds into the school’s name, as governors do not currently have access to the trust.

Expenditure Variance Between TC and Victoria
Q - Governors asked why more money had been spent from the TC Governor account than from the Victoria account.
A - It was confirmed that spending is usually split approximately 50/50 between the two accounts, although small variances may occur. The main driver for the difference is likely to be the returns produced from the underlying investments, rather than from the expenditure split.

Lettings Income
Q - Governors requested an update on lettings income against the budget.
A - It was reported TC has met its lettings budget target, while Victoria has not yet achieved its projected income. The main challenges for Victoria include limited parking and the absence of a site manager outside of normal hours.

Schedule of Financial Delegation 
Governors approved the Schedule of Financial Delegation.

P5 Monitor
Governors reviewed the P5 monitor and sought clarification on staffing expenditure, specifically the £72,000 allocated for two teachers and a £41,000 reduction in TA spending. Governors asked whether the school remains able to appoint the teachers included in the budget, including the full-time Year 5 teacher.
.
BR confirmed that one teacher returning from maternity leave resumed at 0.6 FTE, resulting in a budget saving. Recruitment for a second teacher was unsuccessful; instead, an almost full-time additional TA has been appointed to support Years 3, 4, and 5. BR advised that this strategic decision allows for greater flexibility and targeted pupil interventions. In addition, the budget had initially allowed for several one-to-one support staff, but the actual need was lower than anticipated. 

LD advised governors that some pupils from Swing Gate were initially assessed as requiring one-to-one support but did not ultimately need it. Agency staff were also engaged as required (shown in E26). LD also noted that the budget was set early in the year before the final cohort information was available. BR agreed with LD stating that retaining TAs within classrooms has proven a more effective approach, avoiding the need to reallocate staff across year groups.

Q - Governors sought assurance that the level of intervention support remains appropriate.
A – LD confirmed confidence in the current provision, noting smaller class sizes and well-planned interventions will positively impact pupil outcomes
.
Q - Governors asked whether there were any further priorities for investment.
A - It was reported that an additional teacher works one morning per week with Year 4 pupils. BR confirmed that the current staffing structure is effective, particularly supporting the focus on disadvantaged pupils. Governors were reminded that, in light of reducing pupil numbers, it is essential to remain mindful of budget constraints and therefore the positive impact on the budget would support the strategic direction of the school.

Q - Governors also noted an increase in TA numbers at Victoria and sought clarification.
A - It was confirmed that this is due to maintaining two classes per year group, and therefore retaining existing TA positions.





Nursery and ASC Update
LF advised governors that Nursery pupil numbers increased from 17 at the start of last year to 23 at year end, and currently stand at 32, with 34 expected by Christmas. Due to recent changes in EYFS staffing ratios, this presents some operational challenges but confirmed that the higher numbers will generate additional income.

LD advised governors that at TC, the After School Club (ASC) attendance has risen significantly, with up to 78 children attending on two evenings per week.

M&G Income
BR advised governors that an email was received from the School Building Officer confirming that £13,000 had been received and was being held by the Diocese as custodians of these funds for the federation and governors should decide which investment option to proceed with from:

Ethical investment via CCLA
Review alternative investment companies

Q - Governors asked what restrictions apply to the use of these funds.
A - It was confirmed that the parameters are not yet known. It was agreed that an initial meeting should be arranged with the Diocese advisors to discuss investment options and how to incorporate the Governors’ account.

TT suggested arranging a joint meeting to discuss both the M&G funds and the Governors’ account investments.

6 | HR Update

Staffing Overview
Governors received an update on staffing in the After School Club (ASC). BR advised that staffing costs have been increased due to sickness absence and maternity cover. An ASC manager has been appointed, and additional staff have been recruited to ensure sufficient capacity, as it can be challenging to find short notice cover. LD stated that the new arrangements are reported to be working effectively.

LD advised that additional external lighting had been installed at TC to enable children in the ASC to play outdoors, as the indoor rooms are relatively small for the increased numbers attending.

Leadership Structure
BR advised Governors that Lisa Williamson (Assistant headteacher at TC) will be leaving at Christmas. Recruitment for this post is being considered for September 2026. BR and LD will review and determine the nature of the role before recruitment begins.

Q - Governors asked whether there had been any consideration to appoint a Deputy Headteacher versus an Assistant Headteacher, and what the financial implications might be.
A - It was confirmed that a Deputy Headteacher would command a higher salary. Additionally, within a Head of School structure, an Assistant Head role is more appropriate and maintains consistency across both schools.
Q - Governors also noted that the departing staff member is currently the Mental Health Lead and asked how this responsibility will be managed.
A - It was confirmed that existing staff have either completed, or are currently undertaking, the necessary training to cover this area. It was further noted that appointing a non-teaching Assistant Headteacher would not be financially viable and would be considered during the recruitment process.

Confirm staff register of pecuniary interest 
BR confirmed that 85% of staff have completed the pecuniary interest form, with one member of staff declaring a pecuniary interest.

Staff Communication Survey
Governors were updated on the communication survey feedback, which has been shared with governors via Governor Hub. BR advised that both schools undertook a significant review of communication, and responses have been provided to staff outlining what was said, what actions have been taken, and next steps.
A joint staff newsletter has been introduced, covering TC and Victoria, to celebrate successes and improve transparency. Increased communication also includes updates on staff absences and cover arrangements.

Q - Governors asked whether there had been more negative feedback from Victoria compared to TC.
A - It was noted that this is difficult to measure, as Victoria has a smaller staff team, meaning a few comments can have a greater perceived impact.

EB highlighted several positive outcomes from the survey, including:
Strong sense of care and mutual support among staff
Kind and supportive line management
Positive teamwork observed
Very positive feedback regarding the recent inset day

Governors commended how the leadership team addressed and responded to staff feedback.

7 | Premises, H&S (documents on Governor Hub)

Health & Safety Inspections
LP advised Governors that the Health and Safety inspections for both TC and Victoria took place during the summer term. All documentation relating to the inspections has been made available on Governor Hub.

Q - Governors asked whether the fire brigade inspections had been completed.
A - It was confirmed that inspections were carried out at both schools.

Governors were advised by LP that it is useful to review the summer inspection reports in the Autumn term, to reflect on progress and any outstanding actions, therefore always reviewing actions from the previous term.

Q – Governors queried whether there should be a further Legionella risk assessment commissioned.
A – It was confirmed that as no changes have occurred, no further action was required at this time.
BR advised governors that an asbestos survey had been conducted at TC and they were awaiting the full report.


Staff Wellbeing and Stress Management
Q - Governors enquired whether stress and wellbeing are included within the risk assessment process and how these areas are being addressed.
A - It was confirmed that wellbeing is discussed as part of both full and interim appraisals. In addition, some staff have had specific meetings regarding wellbeing and have been signposted to the school’s insurer, who provides an employee wellbeing package, particularly for those with mental health concerns.

BR advised governors that TR has identified volunteers in both schools to review and develop the Mental Health and Wellbeing Charter.


Accidents and Incident Reporting
Q - Governors asked how information on accidents and incidents is shared with governors.
A - It was confirmed that the Senior Leadership Team at both schools regularly review and monitor incident trends using the Medical Tracker system. Where trends are identified, appropriate action is taken. This information has been shared with the Safeguarding Governor, demonstrating how medical tracker works.

LD advised governors that at TC, the artificial grass surface has become sharp in areas and will be replaced. There were also three recent incidents involving the adventure trail, resulting in three children attending hospital as a result of the injuries. Consequently, the adventure trail has been temporarily closed while pupils are retrained on safe usage. All incidents have been reported to Hertfordshire County Council (HCC).

Q - Governors asked whether the medical tracker data could be shared with governors?
A – BR confirmed that this could be reviewed during the H&S governor visit, reviewing statistics and identifying any recurring themes. 

TT also requested that where it was noted on the H&S report, that there were some incidents but that statistics on these hadn’t been shared with the governors it should state ‘no’ rather than N/A. LP and BR agreed this would be amended on future reports.

8 | GDPR Compliance Update
Governors received an update on GDPR compliance from BR. It was reported that a data breach occurred due to an email being sent to the wrong parent. Appropriate actions were taken to address the incident in line with GDPR procedures.

BR also advised that the federation has changed its Data Protection Officer (DPO) to an HfL adviser. While this provides expertise, it is not a like-for-like replacement, and some additional internal training may be required. This change has resulted in a significant cost saving.
Governors were also informed by BR that two subject access requests from parents of ex-pupils (one at each school) have been received and successfully processed.

9 | Policies/Guidance for review:
The following policies were approved by governors:

Career Break Policy
ECT Policy
Flexible Working Policy
Probationary Policy – EB suggested that additional training may be required, should governors be involved in a probationary hearing
Charging Remissions Policy

10 | Risk Register review of entire document (on Gov Hub)

Governors agreed that the work carried out by TT and the SLT has resulted in an effective risk register being produced.

Governors requested an additional point being added regarding wellbeing, which TT agreed to add.

12 | LD advised Governors that a safety issue had been noted by a parent regarding the front pedestrian gate at TC, which had previously been propped open with a cone.
It was reported by LD that AT has installed a mechanism allowing the gate to close gently. During the day, the gate remains shut, and it can now be secured with a bolt when open, if required.  Governors agreed that practical solution had been implemented, improving safety, however it was agreed that BR would review the need for a risk assessment concerning the gates, with AB offering his support with this task.

LP also provided Governors with an update on the SFVS audit at Victoria. A trainee auditor is currently reviewing the school’s submission and has raised a number of questions, which is normal practice. The school is awaiting the final audit report. TT stated that if LP and BR would benefit from a governor joining the feedback session, he would be happy to support this, BR thanked him for his offer.

13 | Has the meeting been conducted in line with our vision and values? Has the board focused on all pupils and staff being able to flourish in learning and love? Has the meeting been conducted with kindness, respect, resilience, and thankfulness?

All governors agreed that it had been.

4 | Finance 

BR gave thanks to LP, LH and LF for their hard work contributing to the budget setting process.

BR confirmed that there are 4 accounts for each school:
General account
Fund account 
Devolved Formula Capital (DFC)
Governors account

End of year accounts
BR presented an overview of the 24/25-year end accounts (see PowerPoint presentation on Governor Hub). This included BR advising Governors of the following information:

Victoria

A significant expenditure under the DFC was the installation of new toilets at Victoria.
LF secured a wraparound grant for £11,000, which will be paid over 2 years. This will be used to purchase additional resources and provide support for those children with SEND and train staff to effectively meet the needs of the children.
There was a reduction in UIFSM expenditure due to a high number of children having meals on census day, which was not consistent with meal levels throughout the year.
There was an increase in wraparound care over the year, providing an additional £29,000.
The year end was significantly higher than expected in the previous monitor, which has positively impacted the 25/26 budget. The year end carried forward into 25/26 was £396,101.

Q – Why is there a significant increase in period 12?
A - There are various assumptions that are considered when monitoring throughout the year and the actual outturn is not always realised until the final month of the financial year (March). For example: it was anticipated that the utility budgets and subject budgets would be fully spent, however that was not the case. 

Q – Should there be further investment in Safeguarding in the new budget?
A - The decision to continue to use CPOMS provides an extremely effective system that allows staff to record any incident, which alerts the DSL’s. All incidents are reviewed and appropriately managed. 

Q - How often do DSL’s meet? 
A – BR confirmed DSL’s meet weekly. DSL’s review every CPOMS entry and meet to discuss any significant incidents recorded and agree appropriate action. LH advised that she receives approximately 50 CPOMS alerts every day. 

VH advised that in addition, she carries out a termly governor safeguarding visit where the data is analysed using various reports to review the number and range of safeguarding incidents raised by staff. Any personal data and detailed information is not shared with VH, in accordance with GDPR.

Thomas Coram

There have not been any significant purchases through the Fund account in 24/25, as BR knew there would be a larger expense in 25/26. The Fund account will be used to invest in a new Wi-Fi system and support the 
re-decoration of various areas of the school.
There has been a significant increase in the number of attendees in the wraparound care, providing an additional £34,500, this has supported the costs in running the childcare provision.
The telephone system proved cheaper to install than budgeted.
There was also a reduction in various staffing costs such as admin, support staff and teacher costs.
The year end carried forward into 25/26 is £346,485. This was significantly higher than expected in the previous monitor, which has positively impacted the 25/26 budget, which has been due to similar factors that have affected the year end at Victoria, such as a reduction in utility costs, as well as an increase in Additional Targeted Funding (ATF) and SEND funding due to further successful EHCP applications towards the end of the financial year.

For further detail on the Victoria and Thomas Coram year end accounts, the following documents have been shared on Governor Hub:

Budget V actual V committed accruals 
Year-end income from lettings 
Year-end bank accounts 
Cross charging between schools
Monitor 

2025-26 budget 
BR explained the process of budget setting starts in January with BR, LH and LF reviewing staffing structures and considering curriculum priorities and focuses for the next year. In addition, BR and LP meet AT to review the premises priorities. BR advised that the HCC budget guidance, which was shared on Governor Hub, is followed including the assumptions. The contracts are also reviewed, identifying cost savings and any potential increases during contract renewals.

BR advised that when considering the budget, various factors were considered, including potential changes in income associated with pupil numbers, lettings, Sports Premium, SEND funding and the wraparound provision. BR advised that she has been conservative and realistic in her forecast of income, avoiding overly optimistic assumptions.

On the advice from Financial Services, Sports Premium remains in the budget across all years, however whilst schools have been assured funding will remain in place for the 25/26 academic year this may be withdrawn in the near future.

BR explained the impact of pupil numbers on the budget, with each pupil attributing approximately £4,000pa.

BR advised that a significant proportion of each school budget was allocated to staffing and after required expenditure such as utilities, insurance and maintenance costs have been deducted there are minimal funds to spend across other areas.

BR presented an overview of the budgets, shown in the PowerPoint presentation on Governor Hub, which included the following information:

Thomas Coram

BR highlighted that the whole school pupil numbers are budgeted to be 343 in summer 2025, increasing to 346 in the Autumn and Spring term, with a slight increase in Autumn 2026, then falling to 338 in Autumn 2027. Despite some year groups having pupil numbers in the 80s, there remains 3 class teachers in each year group.
Despite not all classes being full, TC does admit pupils throughout the year that are transferring from other schools. In last 3 weeks there have been 6 new children join across the school
There are additional one to ones in the budget to support children accessing the curriculum. There are currently 14 children with EHCP’s, and this number is increasing across all schools in Hertfordshire; having the support in place for them is vital.
The booster groups for core subjects have been very successful so in 3 out of 4 year groups there is an additional teacher allocated in the budget for September. The school is also recruiting for staff to carry our more interventions to support pupil outcomes.
When reviewing the income from wraparound care there has been consideration of a fall in pupil numbers therefore a conservative level of income has been included.
There are contracts that will be reviewed this year, for example the cleaning contract has seen a significant price increase of approximately 11%, which is included in the budget however, it is expected that the outturn will be lower if we move to an alternative provider/negotiate the price.
Under E19, £6000 has been budgeted for curriculum resources, this allows for additional funds to be allocated to the School Development Plan. 

Q - How confident are you that the budget allocated to E19 is enough?
A - All subject leaders request a budget and the priorities in each subject area are considered when allocating the funds. There is also a contingency within the £6000 to allow for further unexpected curricular costs.

Q – The Planned Supply costs (E26) are high at £35,405, have you considered recruiting one additional staff member that could be used across the federation?
A – There has been consideration of recruiting a staff member to provide regular supply, however due to the range of roles, age groups and requirements, along with the frequency of supply needed across both schools, one person would not suffice and therefore the decision was made to liaise with agencies to provide the relevant supply staff as this is also more cost effective. LH advised that she provides an increasing level of cover herself and whilst this is challenging, this also reduces the supply cover costs.

Q - Can we access the pupil: staff ratio?
A - This information is shared in the benchmarking data; it will highlight the school being higher than comparable schools as we employ more staff than some schools however, that is the Federation’s strategy to support children to access the curriculum in the most effective way.

Q - How do you make SEND provision in the budget for those who have not joined the school yet?
A - You cannot anticipate how many in-year admissions the school will receive and what needs the children will have. The school has to pay the first £6,000 towards the one-to-one costs. It is not advised to budget for this eventuality and therefore any additional costs would show as an overspend in the budget. However, during the budget setting process the SENDCO is involved to ensure we have budgeted adequately for the current cohort.

Victoria
There are standard costs across both schools, therefore whilst the amount budgeted varies the budget accounts are very similar to Thomas Coram’s accounts.
BR explained that a whole school approach has been taken to increasing Nursery admission number, with the staff being advocates of the provision provided. There has been a very strong marketing campaign which has included flyers/postcards issued to local estate agents and residents.
Despite the reduction in birth rate the hard work and dedication by staff has resulted in 20 Nursery applications, with a further 4/5 applications in the pipeline
The budget includes 34 pupils for Reception; however, this has now increased to 36 pupils following the first round of continued interest. In future years BR advised that there were 31 Reception pupils budgeted each year, which would require two teachers. Therefore, the budget includes two Reception teachers, with a conservative income.
The Fund account will be used to update the staff room in 25/26, to support staff wellbeing.

Q -  How many children are in Nursery this year?
A – There were initially 17/18 at the beginning of the academic year, this has now risen to 25.

Q – Are there integrated contracts across the federation?
A - There are a number of contracts that both schools purchase such as those provided by HfL but all contracts remain separate. 

Q – There is an increase in staffing expenditure in 26/27, which then falls in future years, can you explain this figure?
A – This will be partly due to additional staffing being on one-year contracts, however, to provide a more in-depth response it was agreed that BR would review the budget and report back to governors.

BR advised that the budgets are looking very positive, as both schools balance over a 3-year period, which is not the general case across schools in Hertfordshire, with many struggling to balance in year 1. It has not been necessary to make any redundancies in this budget however some staff will be moving from Victoria to Thomas Coram due to excess staffing in Victoria: staff are employed by the Federation not the individual school.

Governors approved the budgets, governors thanked BR, LF, LH and LP for their hard work. MV left after the approval of the budget at 8pm, TB left at 7.50pm. | BR

5 | Risk Register review of Section 1 - Strategic and reputational risk

BR asked governors whether they agreed with the risk ratings or whether they felt there should be any amendments. The risk register was created by the former Executive Headteacher and BR welcomed feedback.

Governors agreed that when this document was originally created there were no highlighted concerns around pupil numbers, however it was agreed that the risk level should remain at moderate, due to the implemented mitigation. BR agreed to update the register with the additional mitigation.

Governors agreed that the risk concerning governors having the correct skills should move to moderate, based on the number of governor vacancies at the end of the summer term.

BJ queried that given Victoria’s Ofsted outcome, should the risk level be updated? Governors agreed that given the strong mitigation and the confidence that the objectives were being met and pupil numbers were increasing, the risk rating should remain the same.

It was agreed that LP and BR will review the risk register, including renumbering the document to make it more relevant and effective. The document will initially be sent to Tim for his review and then shared at the next Resources meeting. | BR and LP

6 | Premises / Health and Safety 

TC and Victoria spring inspections 
LP advised that BR, AT and LP conducted a site inspection using the new format (uploaded to Governor Hub). There was a review of previous actions and there were no significant concerns raised.

Q – The report refers to the electrical certificate not being compliant, is this a concern?
A – AT will be reviewing this in the summer term and will ensure that it will be completed in the summer holidays.

Q – The report states that the risk assessments require updating, is this diarised?
A – The risk assessments will be updated in the summer term and will be reviewed for compliance as part of the Autumn check 

Q - The document refers to LW being the mental health lead for both schools, is this correct?
A - LF is the mental health lead for Victoria, LP will update the document accordingly

Rolling programme of works 

BR advised governors that she is meeting with AT to review his maintenance wish list.

Q – The rolling works refers to a new gate installation, is this proceeding?
A -  It was agreed that it was not a concern due to the existing gate system, therefore this will be removed from the rolling works.

Q – Is the dining hall wall art still expected to proceed?
A – It is very expensive, although very attractive. It is on the wish list and may be an item that the Friends of Thomas Coram School could fund, it is still under consideration. | LP

7 | Review of filtering and monitoring 
BR advised that TC is continuing to use Classroom Cloud and whilst it can be over-sensitive, producing many alerts, it is the most robust system BR has used. As part of safeguarding visits VH reviews this and confirmed that she has noticed how sensitive it is, but likewise appreciates how valuable the system is. BR informed governors that she and LH review the alerts and identify trends and any required actions.

GDPR
The Federation has now moved to HfL to provide a GDPR and DPO service. This provides a more cost-effective provision and additional guidance, in addition BR is currently working with various departments within HfL and therefore bringing it under the same supplier will provide a more effective system. The new DPO is Sharon Lindars.

8 | Staffing review from Part 2 minutes 12/02/2025
The budget does not include any reduction in staffing levels and therefore as part of the budget approval there was no further discussion required in relation to the previous part 2 minutes.

9 | Policies/Guidance for review (on Governor Hub):

CCTV Policy – one amendment - approved
Probationary – several amendments - approved
Redundancy – section 1 updated - approved

4 | Review of spending some of the carry forward from TC
 
Solar panel review moved to the start of the meeting taken, prior to review of previous minutes and matters arising, to allow AB to leave following his presentation.

AB and TT have been carrying out a feasibility study (uploaded to Governor Hub) of installing solar panels at Thomas Coram School. AB advised an initial meeting was carried out with AT (site manager) following this, a report was commissioned which confirmed the roof was suitable for solar panel installation. Two proposals were made as part of the report, with proposal 1 recommended as the better design option by Sunsible LLP. AB advised the two options proposed were:

to install 75 solar panels on four roof areas, reducing the school’s electricity bill by approximately £6,307pa, producing 33% of the school’s electricity consumption, at a cost of £37,500. 
To install 41 panels across 2 roof areas, producing 21% of the school’s electricity consumption at a cost of £23,500

AB advised that the excess electricity generated would be exported to the grid and there would be no need for storage batteries on site, which can be unsightly and take up a lot of space.

Q – The proposal considers installing solar panels on the newer more modern building, will it supply both buildings? 
A- It would serve both buildings, with some additional wiring linking the electricity supply between the buildings. 

Q – In the second building the windows are of poor quality and the building lacks effective insulation, would it be cost-effective to spend money on solar panels?
A – Insulation would be the priority, to save energy by reducing heat loss and improve cost-effectiveness.

Q – Could you have a survey on the second building to review the windows as these are of poor quality?
A – The cost of replacing all the windows in the older building would be significant but could be considered as part of this review.

BR agreed that the replacement of the insulation and windows should be reviewed for the second building, however this may be cost prohibitive.

Governors approved that AB and TT could investigate funding options such as government and organisational grants and support from the diocese, to cover the upfront cost of installation

AB was thanked for his contribution and left the meeting at 7.35pm

Budget forecast review
BR and LP presented the most significant areas highlighted in the budget forecast (uploaded to governor hub).
 
Staffing
BR advised there had been a significant amount of sickness this academic year, which has had a significant impact on the budget. 

Q – Should the federation employ a member of staff to act as a cover staff member, on a permanent basis?
A – There are often two or three staff members absent across the various roles, which would make it difficult to employ one person. The cost of employing an agency worker permanently has been considered, however the buyout cost make this option less favourable, compared with using agencies to provide cover. A sickness insurance claim is also pending.

Q - Is sickness usually high?
A - It is often high and by using agency staff we are limiting the impact to that class, rather than spreading it across the school by using internal staff from other classes to cover.
LH advised that she is regularly covering one day a week to limit the impact on the budget, however this is challenging.

BJ agreed that backfilling creates additional challenges and that it makes sense not to pursue this route, however during the next budget year the federation may need to reconsider this and whether agency supply cover is financially sustainable.

Q - How much does it cost to employee an agency teacher?
A - £230.00 per day

Q – Are there any trends in sickness absence? 
A – There are no specific trends however, absence management has been reviewed in line with HCC trigger points, implementing performance plans where necessary. In addition to staff absence there has also been subject leadership time to cover which is essential to maintain, despite staff shortages.


Catering
LP advised governors that there has been a cost saving on UIFSM against the income received.

Q – How is the income and expenditure calculated for UIFSM?
A - The income is based on UIFSM actual numbers on the October and January census day, the expenditure is based on actual UIFSM numbers throughout the year, which can vary. The variances over the year can be either positive or negative, on the forecast a cost saving is shown for 24/25.

Water saving
LP advised there is a £7,000 credit with Castle Water due to incorrect billing, it will stay as a credit balance, with no further payments made until the credit balance is down to zero. BR advised there will be a 25% increase in water costs from 1st April, which is affecting all customers.

E19 – Learning resources
There is a £7000 underspend across learning resource budgets, which is due to the budget being set in April and the school priorities for the next academic year being reviewed in the summer term, after the approval of the budget. BR advised that this is true for all schools and BR prefers to overbudget than underbudget, to allow for contingencies.

TT informed governors that following a discussion with the science lead, the issue of a lack of science budget was raised, is this correct?
LH advised that this statement did not represent the budget allocated to science this year. Since April last year, there has been an increase in spending on science, including a £900 grant. Staff have also been advised that ‘wow days’ should also be included as part of their subject leadership, which would be allocated to their subject budget.

LF advised that Victoria have two whole school ‘wow day’ experiences per term, with ZooLab attending the school soon.

BR advised that all subject leaders are asked to collate a wish list as part of the budget setting process last year and the majority of requests were included in the 24/25 budget, however some of the underspend under E19 is due to the wish list items no longer being required by subject leaders.

IT overspend
LP advised there has been an increase in IT licences, including Pixl. In addition, the DfE advised LA’s that they now wanted to review the IT expenditure in schools in greater detail. This led to a number of new IT budget areas being created after the budget was set, which was beyond the control of schools but resulted in some areas of the budget being overspent and others being underspent. This has shown an increased expenditure under IT for 24/25. This has impacted all schools in Hertfordshire.

5 | SFVS 
BR advised governors that she has reviewed the SFVS and will send it to EB, BJ and TT to consider, this will then be proposed for approval at the March FGB. One area identified is how to ensure the governors review the monitor six times a year. Various options were considered, including the monitor being uploaded to Governor Hub for all governors to access and being reviewed by TT with BR and LP, with any questions from governors being raised through TT. BR to consider how to progress and propose at next FGB.

 
Q - Does the Federation have a 3-year financial plan?
A – The Federation has a 5-year plan and this will be presented at the budget meeting in May as part of budget setting.

Benchmarking
The benchmarking data was shared with governors in advance of the meeting and BR presented the information, advising governors there were no surprises in the data which reinforced the SLT’s understanding of the key areas that impact the budget. BR highlighted the cost of staffing, which were higher than average, was largely down to significant investment in one to ones and interventions. BR also advised that governors could review cost per pupil, which can be benchmarked against other schools, highlighting that when pupil numbers decreased this figure would potentially increase as a class teacher is still required, regardless of whether the class is full.

BJ suggested that given the range of data available, a summary of information would be helpful. On review of the data during the meeting VH identified a report that provided a summary and uploaded these reports, for each school, to Governor Hub.

Bank Account review
LP advised that an overview of the schools’ accounts were uploaded to Governor Hub, with an update on fund accounts included.

Key areas identified by LP were:
Medical tracker was an unexpected cost but will be added to future budgets
£20,000 was spent from the Devolved Formula Capital (DFC) on toilets, in addition 10% must be contributed from the general account, which was included within the budget. LP advised that VAT cannot be claimed back on this expenditure.
Lettings – LP advised there is now an additional letting for netball resulting in increased income
LP informed governors that the phone upgrades will take place over half term 

Wi-Fi update at TC
BR advised governors that RH had allocated £5000 in the 23/24 budget to upgrade the Wi-Fi, which had not been completed and it was therefore carried forward to 24/25. BR has reviewed the options for Wi-Fi upgrades with Con-Ed, in line with the IT strategy. To provide a solution that would future proof the school for the next 10 years the cost would be approximately £7,300, which would be included in the 25/26 budget proposal. BR advised governors that the preference would be for Con-Ed to provide and install the equipment as they provide IT support to the school and have a clear understanding of the IT needs. BR has a second quote should the Wi-Fi equipment be purchased directly through NetGear (suppliers) rather than using Con-Ed. 

BR asked governors if they would be happy to approve the purchase through Con-Ed based on these two quotes, from the DFC in the 25/26 budget. Governors approved this request and BR agreed she would share the quotes with governors following the meeting.

Q – Is this a one-off cost?
A – Yes, there will be an annual licence cost of approximately £300.


TT advised there was a continued delay on the requested signature amendment through Natwest and whether a complaint could be raised. LP advised that there is a significant delay due to the large number of schools that have moved their Fund accounts to Natwest this financial year, with a large number of schools stating it has taken up to 12 months for accounts to be transferred. | BR


















































BR

6 | Review of School Risk Assessment
BR advised that the current risk register, produced by RH is a very detailed document and recommended that governors look at one section per Resources meeting, starting with Section 1 - Strategic and reputational risk, in the next meeting. BJ agreed that was an excellent approach, all governors agreed this would be a more manageable approach. CW to add risk review to each Resources committee meeting agenda.

Health & Safety Termly Inspection Report 

BR advised that the termly inspection was carried out by LP, BR and AT. During this process AT also updated the plan of works and included a wish list, which will be reviewed at budget setting. MT will meet with LP and AT prior to completing the Governors H&S annual inspection. 

BR advised governors that Quinquennial reports must be completed by each school and sent to the Diocese every 5 years. Victoria’s report is out of date, quotes have been requested and the report will be commissioned as a priority. BR informed governors that these reports can be used as supporting evidence for grant requests for any necessary building work. | CW

7 | Review of the filtering and monitoring
BR advised that the school has invested in Classroom Cloud for TC, which is a monitoring system to identify which sites/pupils have had searches filtered, which will monitor all children’s devices, providing reports which highlight who searched for a specific word/image including the actual words used. 

LH advised that she has reviewed the trigger words in the reports and has found it very useful, no significant concerns have been raised.

8 | Staffing updates
BR advised there are 2 maternity leave covers in place and 2 resignations (one at each school). Absence remains the biggest concern for both schools.

Governors discussed staffing plans for September, which are included in Part 2 Minutes.

Update on the Performance Management interim reviews
BR advised all review meetings will be conducted by Easter and all staff were asked to complete a RAG rating on their progress and annotate their review documents accordingly. 

Early Careers Teacher support
LF advised that one ECT has passed their first year successfully, the ECT time out of class has subsequently been reduced and LF is now looking at which subject the ECT would like to shadow. LF informed governors that the second ECT is progressing very well and is benefiting from the increased level of support, compared with her previous school.

11 | Any other business

Ramp renovation
LF advised that ramp renovations between Nursery and Reception were planned for the Easter holidays, improving accessibility and outside space for children. This has required significant investment which has been raised through VSA fundraising and a £15,000 donation by Lawson Trust. LF advised this would consist of composite decking, due to minimal maintenance, and reinforced fencing. Two quotes have been obtained, one provided by an existing parent for £17,412 and a second quote for £24,114.

Lockdown procedures
BR provided an update on lockdown practices, clarifying the definition of ‘lockdown’ being if someone entered the site to cause damage or injury. A drill was conducted during the inset day to limit impact on children. BR advised that during the drill it was identified that staff could not hear the alarm in all areas therefore a walkie talkie system has been introduced for both schools. Teachers are already using walkie talkies and are therefore used to charging them each day, this procedure would ensure the majority of staff would be quickly alerted of an intruder. BR advised that an annual drill will take place on an inset day.

12 | Has the meeting been conducted in line with our vision and values? Has the board focused on all pupils and staff being able to flourish in learning and love? Has the meeting been conducted with kindness, respect, resilience, and thankfulness?

Governors all agreed that it had been conducted in line with the Federations vision and values.

3 | Minutes of P&C meeting 2nd October.2024 and Matters Arising
The Governing Board approved the previous minutes, these will be marked as agreed on Governor Hub. No matters arising.

4 | Action points from meeting of 2nd October 2024:

BR to arrange for the subject leads to provide examples of the new Hertfordshire Writing Scheme at the next P&C meeting. (5)
BR to arrange for the Pixl presentation to be shared on Governor Hub - completed

5 | New writing curriculum update - LW
LW shared her presentation on Essentials Writing, which she will upload onto Governor Hub, following the meeting.
LW informed governors that the reason this scheme was chosen was research-based. One of the key elements that attracted the SLT to this scheme was the clear progression that can be identified for each child 
LW advised that this scheme encourages children to understand what they are going to write about and focuses on them writing as writers, considering the various steps including producing a draft, proof-reading, editing and presenting to a real audience.
LW stated that a strong aspect of the scheme is that the teaching of grammar is intrinsic and relevant.

The scheme also supports newer and experienced teachers with detailed unit plans supplied so teachers have a clear idea of how the lesson should be conducted, including adaptations for learners 

LW advised that the inclusion of explicit modelling within the scheme is the most effective way of teaching writing as it reviews how a writer writes and the impact on the reader. It also uses strong, high quality texts which are varied and support the children with the writing they are working on.

LW informed governors that the scheme had been used in Year 3 and 6 since October half term, as a soft launch, with this being rolled out to the whole school (Thomas Coram) from January. There has been a high level of positive feedback since the scheme was implemented. 

Victoria also introduced the scheme with Year 1 October half term, which had a powerful impact. LF advised that following book reviews and observations, she identified an improvement in the children’s understanding of the purpose of writing and has witnessed increased confidence in their abilities which has extended into other areas, such as spelling. LF informed governors that Victoria will now be trialling Reception.

Q – It looks very structured, and helpful and teacher feedback is really positive, is there an assessment element to the scheme?
A – The teachers assessment framework sits alongside the scheme, which are both produced by HfL. | LW

6 | Termly pupils' outcomes and monitoring

Assessment updates and impact of interventions and boosting

Thomas Coram
LH advised that assessments have taken place in September and January (this week and next), using Pixl. Children have not made as much progress as had been expected in writing, therefore the decision has been made to use Pixl for reading and maths whilst working with teachers to review the teacher assessments for writing. The English adviser is going to attend TC in March, to support this.

LH gave an example of the success of Pixl by advising that last year a Year 6 child was working at a Year 3 level and in Sept, when taking a SATS paper they were 5 marks away from achieving a age-related score. 

SG has been doing Maths papers in Year 4 and has seen a significant improvement, with some children who were achieving single figures out of 100, now achieving double figures. SG stated that Pixl supports the next steps, by using data analysis to identify the gaps and providing intervention lesson plans to help fill these gaps.
BR agreed that the interventions in Year 6 have been very effective and has also supported a smooth transition between a class teacher and a cover teacher (covering maternity leave).

LH advised that Year 6 will be doing their assessments this week, following the analysis of this data she will upload the information onto Governor Hub. 

Victoria
LF advised that Pixl has supported teacher assessment as some teachers are cautious when marking the children’s progress.

Baseline data has been conducted with Yr1, with reading writing and maths. Little Wandle has been an effective tool to monitor phonics in Reception and Year 1 and understanding specifically how a child is performing is very powerful. Those that are not highlighted as green, will be retaking their phonics. LF advised that there is clear evidence that Year 1 reading and fluency has becomes stronger through reteaching and consolidated learning. 

Q – A big priority is closing the gaps, as you have said, are you finding the schemes identify the gaps?
A – LH said she had not used Pixl before but one thing that appealed to her was managing the gaps and Pixl clearly identifies these gaps, following assessments. If there are whole class gaps, we have starter sessions during lessons and TA’s running interventions with small groups.

Q – How is Pixl embedding with staff, is it proving useful or a burden? 
A -  It is very useful and provides a consistent approach, it can pinpoint the gaps and provide the relevant resource to support teachers and TA’s to fill those gaps.

LF stated that Pixl is being used with Year 2, although they do not have the staffing to champion it in Victoria, due to the smaller pool of staff. LF agreed it is a very useful tool, however staff are struggling to find the time to use the resource as do not have an expert in school, so it will take more time to embed it. LH advised that Pixl is largely aimed at key stage 2 children, supporting children getting ready for their SATS.

BR informed governors that they have asked their Pixl expert to identify an infant school that are using Pixl effectively so they can arrange a visit to support expansion of the tool at Victoria.

Q- There has been a lot of time and effort when rolling out Pixl, will parents be informed?
A –The federation does not share the assessment processes, just the progress. In October parents evening parents were advised of their child’s gaps and this will continue in future parents’ evenings.

Governors agreed that the introduction of Pixl was already proving a success and looked forward to seeing further data in the future.

Pupil survey
BR advised that the pupil survey was conducted in November, prior to an SEA visit considering personal development. The areas highlighted in yellow, on the report, are areas that require further work, these were also areas that the children highlighted in their survey.

KH thanked Beccy for the information and agreed that the outcomes from the survey looked very good | LH

7 | PINS – update and action plan 

LH advised that she attended a meeting last week to review progress, working with a small team in Hertfordshire that work with staff individually and in classrooms, considering how lessons are structured and adaptive teaching. 

During learning walks LH and ST have seen adapted learning, which is a significant improvement. LH advised that they are expecting positive feedback from the PINS team when they visit next week.

8 | Intent, implementation, and impact of the curriculum update

BR advised that the current budget included HfL subject advisers reviewing the foundation subjects, considering how robust the plans are to ensure progression.  This has now taken place, reviewing all 4 areas (Art, D&T, Computing and Music) with two afternoon sessions per subject. The first meeting provided a review of current practices, the subject leader was then given the opportunity to consider this feedback before the second meeting, which agreed a way forward. This process required significant investment and based on the high level of positive feedback from teachers, it has been value for money. The main benefit being cited by staff is the consistent approach to progression from Year 2 to 6.
 
LF advised that staff appreciated the identification of key tasks that children should complete prior to moving to the next year group. 

Q –The joining up of the curriculum is one of the federations priorities, overall have teachers found this process useful?
A - Teachers have found this very useful. In addition, an inset day was spent looking at subject leadership, which provided the teachers with structured time to consider their subject and the expectations. The subject leaders of each school also worked together reviewing action plans, RAG ratings, priorities, strengths and time frames. The staff were given one month’s notice so they could prepare for the inset day, to ensure effective use of the day. The accountability of this exercise has been very beneficial and has provided BR and the Heads of both schools with a clear understanding of the next steps.

Q – Is this something staff are appraised on?
A – All teachers have a subject strategy, so they would be reviewed as part of the appraisal process.

BR advised that during the summer term there will be a governor’s curriculum report on each subject, collated into one document for each school.

NF stated that as the P&C meeting was in April, could it be moved to later in the term when the reports would be available, so they could be reviewed at the meeting. It was agreed that a change of dates would be considered by BR and EB outside of this meeting. | BR/EB

9 | SEA Visit feedback from 4th and 5th December – Personal Development deep dive 
Protected characteristics 
Participation in extracurricular activities (including vulnerable pupil) 
Career programme

BR informed governors that the federation has considered how vulnerable children access extracurricular clubs, which is an area that will be focussed on next term, including consideration of unconscious bias, which BR and LH have recently reviewed.

BR advised that on review of the pupil survey Linda (SEA) stated that some areas identified as personal development were not necessary.

KH stated there were a lot of positive responses from Linda, including how valued the children said they felt and how they referred to TC as a special place.

BR agreed and advised governors that despite the PSHE leads being apprehensive, Linda was overwhelmed by how well the schools support the children and the comprehensive subject knowledge of the PSHE leads. 

Q – The outcome was impressive and in particular how the pupil survey picked up on the federations visions and values. Are there any quotes we could use from the report for marketing purposes?
A - At the marketing meeting it was decided that there would be a governor’s newsletter, and these comments would be very powerful to use in the newsletter. In addition, the marketing committee are also considering have a collection of testimonies on the website. LF and BR had been reviewing the SEF at Victoria and included some of these comments. Following a collective worship audit from the diocese, which was very productive, these quotes will also be valuable for the SIAMS. 

External monitoring – English, Maths and EYFS report
LF advised there have been a sequence of visits in EY, from the EY adviser, to review child initiating learning and looking at linking activities to themes and topics. Previously there was minimal thread and theme linked to activities, this process has now been simplified, with a working document now on the wall to ensure all adults understand the purpose of each activity. In addition, the planning had been very subject specific, now there is an overarching theme. These changes have had a positive impact on the team.

The next EY adviser visit will review the progression of those children that are struggling. 

Q – Are staff under a lot of pressure at the moment?
A – Staff absences at Victoria have been difficult and this increases the pressure on the team, however the EY visit was met with a positive approach and staff are now happier. Both teachers are relatively new to the role, these changes have reduced their workload and created more clarity over linking activities.

10 | Governor visits: Outcome of monitoring activities Link visit report (on Governor Hub)

EB thanked governors for uploading the completed documents, which contained valuable consideration and feedback. EB advised she had identified that there were some issues concerning where the documents were stored. CW to consolidate folders to ensure consistent approach to storing completed documents, in the relevant month.

ID apologised for the delay in his report, informing governors that whilst he had met with some staff at TC, he was yet to meet with Lisa Williamson, due to his work schedule, but was hoping to arrange a mutually agreeable date shortly.

EB advised governors that there was a good level of detail gathered and highlighted the benefit of these meetings.

TB advised that she had a very productive meeting with Rebecca Sergeant (RS) and was overwhelmed by how structured the Nursery lessons were and the approach to delivering the content. TB’s visit concentrated on Nursery, during her next visit she will focus on Reception. TB informed governors that RS stated there was often no data from pre-schools when children entered Reception, which created additional challenges.

Q – What are Victoria doing to support those children from other provisions?
A – RS tries to engage with other nurseries; however, it is difficult to understand the progression of each child, due to limited statistics. Previous settings may not have raised concerns with parents over a child’s progression due to fear of losing that child from their setting. Despite these challenges LF felt that by the beginning of the Spring term, the majority of children from previous settings had caught up with those attending Victoria nursery

EB thanked SH for the two comprehensive maths reports. SH advised that she was very impressed by Pixl, in particular how useful it was to identify trends. SH also stated that she felt her visit was more effective, in addition to reducing her workload, following the split between link visits and normal governor visits.

EB advised that the vision and values statement had now added to the bottom of all governor visit forms, so in future this would prompt that discussion. | CW

11 | SIP updates 
LH advised that the progress is highlighted on the report. The knowledge organisers will hopefully be finished by the end of this year but will not be used until next academic year.

KH referred to the SIP as a work in progress document that is regularly reviewed, stating that a significant proportion of the discussion today has reviewed progress of the plan.

LH advised that a resilience programme, led by Lisa Williamson will be implemented after Easter, which will be fully embedded next year from September.


Q – How are you promoting resilience?
A – For the classroom the federation has invested in a programme called Storm breakers, this will build on movement breaks and mental wellbeing

BR advised that she has used it at her previous school which was very effective. Teachers have been building daily brain breaks into teaching but not consistently. Stormbreak, which is funded by Sports Premium, focusses on five different areas of mental wellbeing and resilience, providing a consistent approach across the whole federation which is enjoyable for children. BR agreed to provide an update on the progress at the next P&C meeting.

Victoria SEF 
BR and LF worked on the Victoria SEF for a day, reviewing achievements since the Ofsted visit. LF advised that following various external visits and focussing on key areas, they had received a range of validations that the Ofsted targets had been met.

KH commented that the SEF looks very comprehensive and responses to issues raised a year ago are well expressed, highlighting what has happened and the resulting outcome. LF agreed, stating they can demonstrate that they have been robust in their approach to improving their performance.

BR advised that Linda will be coming in on 5th February to review reading and phonics, to ensure she can validate the progress we have highlighted.

Q – Will governors be required when Ofsted return?

A -  Governors would be required as this will be a full section 5 visit when they return

BR suggested booking an Ofsted governor refresher course during the Autumn term, which is offered through the Diocese and HfL, to review the new scorecard, this was agreed by governors. BR reminded governors of the importance of being familiar with the SEF. | BR

12 | Policies/Guidance for review

RE Policy 
Lisa from the Diocese worked with both subject leaders, which they found very useful and is continuing to work with them to review the delivery of the RE curriculum.

.
No conflicts of interest declared.

3 | Approval of minutes of FGB meeting 21st May 2025 and Matters Arising. CW advised that Associate Members should not hold a link role. Governors requested that CW provide clarification on the source of this information.

Actions from meeting
Clare to circulate the policies spreadsheet, governors to comment by 6th June – completed, no comments received
EB will liaise with governors to arrange review meetings prior to the end of term - Bev and Vicky outstanding, Handover discussion to take place prior to governors resigning. Short meeting conducted with Ian.
NB-W to reach out to potential new governor and pass on EB’s contact details – resulted in successful recruitment of Chris Cartwright. EB also meeting with another prospective governor next week
EB to review possibility of Associate Governors becoming full governors with SO, TB and MT, in addition to Anthony Boden who has been actively involved with governors, by 2nd July 2025 - ongoing
KH to review heightening the profile of governor vacancies, with SO through the church and report to governors at the next FGB – no successful applicants
BR/MT to circulate governor newsletter to local churches - Governors agreed the newsletter looked very good and thanked Mark for his hard work and any other governors who contributed
All governors to actively support recruitment of Foundation Governors - ongoing
All governors to consider what roles they would like to carry out next academic year, to be reviewed at next FGB – see point 5
MT/VH to conduct a handover meeting for the safeguarding governor role, prior to the end of term - completed
BR will gather the feedback from the post it notes and use it to update the 5-Year Strategic Plan. The updated version will be presented at the next FGB meeting – see point 6 | MT to distribute

4 | Wellbeing Survey - TR to share action plan, following the Wellbeing Survey (from Resources on 14th May 2025)

31/80 staff responded (16 TC, 13 Victoria, 2 federation-wide) – governors queried the low level of responses, BR advised that given when the survey was carried out (last year), this was not surprising, however a recent communication survey has been carried out with a higher response rate.

The SENDCO at TC highlighted her high volume of direct parent contact. While necessary for certain matters, such as EHCP applications, parents will be reminded in the Autumn term that the class teacher should handle most queries first.

BR noted that some negative responses were provided by staff who do not undertake that particular role, rendering the answers irrelevant. Governors questioned whether such responses should be excluded from the data set; however, as no significant concerns were identified and the relevant roles could be identified, the data was retained.

BR recognised that staff absence at Victoria had a significant impact on morale, with staff covering additional duties and experiencing increased stress, Governors acknowledged that all possible steps had been taken to mitigate this.

Q – The feedback regarding safeguarding was surprising given that no significant safeguarding concerns have been reported recently

A – This was due to an increase in the use of CPOMS across various roles including Midday Supervisory Assistants, which has improved the information captured in CPOMS, but has given staff an additional task. Governors agreed this was a positive improvement.

Governors highlighted the negative comments regarding the use of display boards and felt that the boards added value. BR and LH agreed, explaining that although wall space is limited, the leadership team is committed to showcasing the importance of all subjects, and pupils take pride in displaying their work.

In conclusion BR advised Governors that whilst the data was useful, the information obtained through the communication survey has already proved more valuable, with some quick wins already identified. SLT will publish results of survey in October FGB. | CW agenda for FGB

5 | Governor roles:

EB advised Governors that following the recruitment of Chris Cartwright and potentially MT and TB moving from Associate Members to Governors, this will leave one vacancy, which will hopefully be filled next week.

EB thanked TT for volunteering to be Vice Chair of Governors, EB would mentor him to support his potential transition to Chair of Governors in September 2026, if he was successfully appointed.

The following governors also volunteered for specific roles:

MT – Vice Chair of Resources
MV – Chair of Admissions
N B-W – Chair of P&C, with the support from KH for the Autumn term as Co-Chair
TB and MV jointly taking on Complaints, G&A and Pupil & Staff discipline

EB asked Governors to review the roles document prior to the Strategy meeting, which would be updated in Governor Hub, and request any amendment necessary.

6 | 5 Year Strategic Plan

BR advised that the post it notes from the previous meeting were very useful and has identified the key points across the pillars:

Educational excellence linked to SIP in both schools including: reviewing key data points, consistency across internal monitoring and Year 4 multiplication check to improve outcomes.
Continuous improvement of the culture of safeguarding across the federation.
Happiness and Wellbeing including using Stormbreak in all classes to provide mental health and wellbeing physical breaks, staff and parent surveys, parent workshops and annual staff teambuilding event.
Community – highlighted as a key area where governors could support the federation with ideas to improve this area.
Sustainability – financial sustainability - review through SFVS audit at Victoria, supporting recruitment and retention, developing a digital strategy with support from Con-ed. Environmental sustainability – Developing a climate change action plan utilising online models 
Q – How is recruitment progressing in the federation?
A – Schools are continuing to find this a challenging area. Despite the Federation having links with universities and signing up to offer placements, it has been difficult, however, the teacher vacancy was successfully filled.

7 | Exec-Headteacher Report

Governors reviewed the reports and raised the following questions, with additional commentary provided by BR.

Payscales
BR advised governors that the SLT have been discussing pay structures, and there are people doing the same job across the federation but receiving different pay rates. While the financial impact isn’t significant, pay should be consistent and aligned across the board. Governors agreed this was a fair approach.

Q - What is the total cost?

A - £703 at Victoria and £1300 at TC in the first year, increasing in future years when staff move up their payscale.

Q – There has been some staff movement between TC and Victoria, has there been any significant budgetary impact?

A – As the movement filled a vacancy there has been no increase in costs at TC, but it has resulted in a reduction in costs at Victoria.

Carry forward
Q - Will there be any clawback based on the carry forward

A – The carry forward shall be allocated to larger projects, at which point the carry forward will be below the clawback threshold

SFVS audit

Q – Is any support required from Governors?

A – The audit is remote, and all the information requested has been submitted to the auditors. There will be a questionnaire for governors to complete in due course. 

BR thanked governors for their support and confirmed the audit would take place in September.

Nursery intake
Governors agreed the uptake in nursery applicants is excellent, with 26 confirmed applicants and a potential further two visiting the school next week.

Q - How do we know the upturn in figures has been based on the excellent work that has been carried out at Victoria? Are other schools securing a full cohort?

A - Many schools are struggling with admissions, with some nurseries closing. Victoria is in a very fortunate position; the hard work and dedication from the team has made a significant difference.

Vision and Values
Q – A year ago, we carried out a stakeholder consultation—how has the federation since developed its focus on vision and values with children and parents?

A – Children are now able to articulate the federation’s vision and values. Teachers and Heads of School are embedding them more actively in daily practice. At Victoria, roleplay activities and class discussions around vision and values have increased. The weekly newsletter now includes regular references to vision and values, and parents are engaging more, supported by initiatives such as the introduction of prayer bears (following the audit). The federation also maintains an active social media presence, showcasing how the vision and values are being demonstrated.

Governors agreed that there has been clear progress in embedding the vision and values across the federation.

Head of School’s Reports 

Victoria

Q – The report show “good” throughout, but there could be some areas described as “outstanding.” It doesn’t clearly highlight where we are excelling. 

A – The SEF identifies areas of strength as well as priorities for improvement and remains the key reference document. At Victoria, for example, attitudes and behaviour are judged to be outstanding.

Governors agreed how valuable some of the SEA visit quotes were and congratulated the school on graduating from the English Hub programme. 

Q - What personal development opportunities are there for SEND pupils in extracurricular activities? 

A - Attendance at clubs can be low for pupils with SEND, as they are often loud and noisy. A pupil voice exercise is planned to understand this further. Funding may be available through the Sports Premium or Pupil Premium if these pupils are considered disadvantaged. This aligns with our wider focus on supporting disadvantaged and vulnerable children, will now be referred as VIPs, very important pupils.

Q – Is the medical tracker used at Victoria?

A – Only TC use the tracker due to managing a higher number of pupils and less face to face contact with parents. The majority of injuries at Victoria are dealt with at the office and parents informed on collection. 

Q - Attendance monitoring – there has been a significant increase in unauthorised holidays. Is this seasonal, and how are we setting expectations with parents? Does the policy also apply to Nursery?

A: Attendance will be addressed at parents’ evening and discussed with teachers in September. Parents are required to apply for term-time leave, and attendance is being closely monitored. Confirmation will be sought regarding Nursery.


Q - The number of SEND parents has increased significantly, why is this?

A – Teachers are more rigorous in identifying children, with the SENDCO offering classroom support and engaging external services


Thomas Coram

Q - Can you explain what is meant by “fluid groupings”?	

A - In Years 4 and 5, pupils are organised into three groups, and in Year 6 there are four groups, some designed to provide additional support, others to extend learning.
A recent learning walk highlighted challenges within some groups, as a result, it was decided to introduce group splits in Years 5 and 6, but not in Year 4. This approach requires a fourth group to continue effectively. While the budget allows for three additional teachers, there are currently two (shared across Years 5 and 6), with additional TAs now supporting Years 3 and 4, which is proving effective.

Q: There are 103 SEND pupils—at what point would an additional SENDCO be needed?

A: The SENDCO provides support to teachers, who are handling the majority of the work. Her hours have increased to four days, but the emphasis is on the teachers implementing interventions in class., for example. She has also spent time at Swing Gate and Victoria to ensure effective handovers, both internally and with other schools.

Governors agreed the transition is very strong at Thomas Coram and Victoria.

Q: Regarding VIP pupils, how well are they accessing extracurricular clubs?

A: Only two children with an EHCP are currently attending clubs. Some do not wish to participate in sporting clubs, although a high number of SEN pupils do attend. LH has supported two children by accompanying them to clubs to help with their transition.

Attendance - LH advised governors that there is no significant attendance concerns overall, although there is an increase in unauthorised absence due to parents taking holidays in term time, often on a termly basis (10 weeks apart) therefore avoiding fines. There is also a high number of children experiencing emotional school avoidance. A new scheme is being trialled with one family to support attendance, given the significant amount of work only one family has been selected.

Governors noted the substantial work being undertaken.

8 | P2 monitoring reports 

Governors reviewed the P2 reports and raised the following questions:


Q – There is a shortfall of £7500 SEN funding, why is this?

A - This was entered into the budget across 3 terms, rather than 2..

Q – There are £1500 additional telephone charges, why is this?

A – The extended BT contract until July, along with some unbudgeted ongoing charges, caused this situation

Q: Why is there an increase in support staff costs (E03)?

A: The staff member was needed earlier than originally anticipated.

9 | BASH – mobile phones strategy – see Bridgewater documents on Gov Hub

BR advised Governors that at a recent BASH meeting the significant parental and school pressure around mobile phone use, particularly in secondary schools was raised.  If schools take a strong stance on this, it will support parents in setting boundaries. Ashlyns plans to introduce a mobile phone ban for Year 7 students from September 2026 and has asked schools to inform parents that, should they purchase a smartphone, this policy will apply at Ashlyns.

Q: From a parent’s perspective, it is much easier if there is a collective decision.
A: This is why SLT are supporting this approach. In secondary schools, mobile phones can cause behavioural issues. At Bridgewater, parents requested the ban of phones and the school have agreed for us to share this point with parents. The staff member leading the initiative is also willing to speak with our parents.

Governors confirmed they supported this decision. However, it was agreed that until Ashlyns decision has been ratified by their Governors BR will not share this information with parents. Discussions may develop within parent groups around the option of non-smartphones, but the school will not police this. It was also noted that some children rely on phones for practical purposes, such as paying for transport.

10 | Policies/Guidance for review include (on Gov Hub):

Code of Conduct - employees
Governors approved the Code of Conduct however some formatting issues on table of contents (point 15) required and a slight amendment to Beccy’s name to Ms Roberts for CW to complete prior to publishing.

Safeguarding visit 

ID & VH reported the annual safeguarding audit shows no major concerns, CPOMS is well-used with spot-checks, and the single central record is fully up to date. VH advised that data is drawn from CPOMS to analyse what has been recorded across the school. The filtering and monitoring system and medical tracker is also reviewed, which Governors agreed are both being used effectively

An additional improvement has been enhancing the new-starter induction day which now incorporates all mandatory training.


Q - Can teachers access prevent training easily? There were some challenges when governors tried to locate the training
A – There is an online training course available for staff and Governors. It was agreed that ID would provide clarity for governors.






Private Therapists

BR advised that in both schools there are an increasing number of private therapists coming in to support children. Clubs pay a fee to use the premises, however the therapists are not charged. Our Lettings policy states all businesses will be charged. 

Q How many children are seen by private therapists?

A There are approximately 2-3 practioners, with 10-20 children being involved

Q – Does the school have an obligation to support this provision? If a charge is introduced will the therapist withdraw their service

A – There is no obligation. It can be beneficial for children, however there is the disadvantage that they are missing areas of the curriculum.

Governors agreed that LP will create a proposal to be reviewed in the next Resources meeting.

14 | Has the meeting been conducted in line with our vision and values? Has the board focused on all pupils and staff being able to flourish in learning and love? Has the meeting been conducted with kindness, respect, resilience and thankfulness?

Governors agreed that the meeting was conducted in this manner.

EB thanked Bev for all her time and dedication, EB will share the Governors appreciation to Nicola and Nick who are leaving and absent from today’s meeting. In addition, EB thanked Vicky for her valuable 10 years of service, with her experience and energy. Thanks, were also given to KH who agreed to stay for a further term to support the P&C committee and to all Governors for their contribution and support this year.

Finally, Governors thanked Lucy, Lisa and Beccy for outstanding leadership. BR thanked EB for her fantastic support over the past year.

4 | Update of governor emergency contact details on Governor Hub
All governor contact details are up to date

5 | NB-W has agreed to take on roll of role of SEND/PPG link governor and will move to the P&C committee as this utilises her skill set. EB thanked SH for moving back to Resources, to allow this. EB will now focus on her new link role of Personal Development, Behaviour & Attitudes governor.

EB highlighted that BJ, KH and NF are stepping down and therefore including the current vacancy, there will be four foundation governor vacancies in September. The Diocese has provided some helpful guidance; however, the recruitment of governors must be in line with the Instrument of Governance. EB requested the support of governors to identify any potential candidates and direct them towards BR or EB.

Q – Would the number of foundation governors impact the outcome of a SIAMS visit?
A - Yes, the inclusion of foundation governors is of vital importance to the federation. The Instrument of Governance stipulates that there must be 9 Foundation Governors out of a total board of 16, in addition there must be a majority of 2 foundation governors over non-foundation governors.

Q - What obligation falls under the Diocese to appoint foundation governors?
A – Foundation governors must be practising Christians, and some are appointed by local churches. However local churches are struggling to recruit certain roles, such as church warden, within their own congregations, therefore filling a governor vacancy from the same pool, may prove challenging. 

Q - Could the federation contact churches outside the community?
A – This could be a possibility, if the vacancies cannot be filled. EB advised that she is meeting with SO next week, to discuss the matter.

MV suggested setting a timeframe for the initial approach through the local churches. If this proves unsuccessful, SO may be able to offer greater flexibility on suitable candidates. MV advised that he is happy to support the recruitment process. EB thanked MV for his offer of support and will discuss his suggestions with SO. | All governors
















EB

6 | Review ‘Governance in a Christian Manner’ (uploaded to Governor Hub by LF to support SIAMS inspection)

LF summarised the document stating that it provided a strong foundation, highlighting the responsibility to work together in a Christian manner, with the school and governors. 

Governors agreed it was a valuable document.

7 | Review governor visit process 
To receive link Governor Visit reports (3rd March) and feedback 

Review of drop in week process
Governors found the recent drop-in week a more positive experience, with the majority of staff members proactively reaching out to book meetings, within the agreed two-week period. 

Two staff members had not provided feedback on their visit report; therefore, governors had not uploaded their report to Governor Hub. BR apologised and recommended that governors provide staff with a feedback window of one week, highlighting the due date for their response when they submit the report. This was agreed by governors.

Review of visit reports
EB reviewed the reports on governor hub and highlighted the following:

ID’s link report, shared on email (now showing on Governor Hub) was very useful, given the focus on the new writing scheme. ID provided a very detailed analysis and supported increased context for other visits. EB asked all governors to review ID’s report prior to the next governor visits, as the focus will be writing.
MV shared that he recognised the importance of preparation prior to the visits to support a more effective outcome, by considering how an area fits into the curriculum. MV agreed that ID’s report was valuable for all governors to review.
SH’s review of the spiritual ambassadors highlighted some positive and creative ideas that was beneficial for the church, school and governors. 
TB highlighted that there was a budget shortfall for the remodelling of the area outside Nursery, so an innovative approach had been taken to raise the additional funds, using a parent fundraising webpage.
TT’s report provided some very positive feedback for the science leads. TT highlighted that his only criticism was that some teachers did not have cork boards and instead had created boards using tape. LH advised that the presentation of classrooms had been highlighted during SEA visits and is currently on the SLT agenda. The objective is to have a consistent approach across all classrooms, by September. 
EB highlighted that some governors omitted to include confirmation that the vision and values were being demonstrated during their visit. Governors agreed that whilst this had taken place, there was some issues with the formatting of the form and they struggled to add these comments. SG advised that she will review the forms prior to the next governor visit week. 

VH advised governors that during her visit, the children were very excited to show their books and teachers supported this activity. BR agreed that the ‘book look’ is more valuable when a teacher is reviewing the books with governors, as they can review the consistency and progress against expectations. 

BR advised that the SLT are currently reviewing the marking scheme to ensure a consistent approach is being taken across all year groups. Once completed, governors will be able to review how this is being implemented across the federation. | All governors

8 | HoS and Exec HT reports to governors
Progress towards the School Development Plan/ Federation action plan

Exec-Head’s report to governors

Governors thanked BR for her detailed Exec-Head report.

Q - Under vulnerable pupils there is reference to a federation plan, is there a timescale? 
A – BR informed governors that she met with a District SEA who leads on vulnerable pupils. The SEA shared a spreadsheet that calculates a vulnerability score based on the information that is populated about the child. Whilst BR is not considering allocating a score to pupils, it was a valuable exercise and highlighted that it is not just disadvantaged children that are vulnerable. The SEA will conduct staff training next term, promoting a culture change particularly around the type language used by staff and considering the impact of unconscious bias. During the meeting the SEA also highlighted the benefit of building relationships with parents, stating a supportive relationship can accelerate learning by 3 years.

BR advised that 37 Reception offers have been issued and therefore BR anticipates they will require two Reception classes in September. BR confirmed that if Reception numbers increase beyond 30, two teachers are required.

Q – If the school starts with 28 pupils and increases to 33, is another class required?
A – Yes, there are strict rules regarding Early Years ratios.

Thomas Coram HoS report
LH advised governors that the PINS training has been completed and a review is booked with the PINS team to consider the progress made. LH received a vast range of resources during the last PINS session, valuing approximately £400, these have been handed out to classes.

Victoria HoS report
LF advised that the moral within the school has improved significantly. The SEA visit included a lot of positive language and LF feels the school is now in a strong place and working through the Ofsted criteria. LF advised that the improvement over the past year has been fantastic and the reaffirmation from external sources is very motivational for the whole staffing team.
Progress towards SDP and Federation Action Plan

Q – What further support is required to move the whole school approach to resilience, to green? 
A – There have been other whole school focusses that have taken priority. However, during the summer term, 5 staff members will have 8 different training sessions. The information will be disseminated throughout the staffing team in September. 

Q - The SENCO roles and responsibilities area is in yellow; how are this being moved forward?
A – This area is ongoing, rather than not being met. Due to the nature of the role LH advised that there would always be ongoing changes to SENCO priorities.

Sustainability committee – TT advised that AB has been doing a great job and he provided a summary to the Resources committee.

TT confirmed this process is halfway through.
Marketing committee – MT advised that the objectives and USP’s have been agreed and the committee meet every couple of months.

Q - Are other schools in Berkhamsted struggling with pupil numbers?
A - Yes, with the exception of two schools, all are struggling

5-year Plan – BR advised that she has met with EB to review the principle of splitting the 5-year plan between governors, so individual governors are overseeing specific areas. EB requested that all governors review the plan and identify an area that meets their skill set or interest, then inform EB, prior to the next FGB meeting.

2 | Conflicts of Interest and Apologies for Absence
Apologies were received and accepted from LH, SO, BJ, NG, VH and LF
.
No conflicts of interest declared.

3 | Approval of Admissions Policy

EB asked Governors to approve the recommended decision by the Admissions Committee, on 13th January 2025, to approve the admissions policies and associated documents for Victoria and Thomas Coram for 2026-27. These policies were approved.

EB asked Governors to approve the proposed amendment to the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the Admissions Committee, allowing the Admissions Committee to approve all Admission policies and associated documents, without requiring FGB approval. There were some points that Governors approved this decision. (See Governing Hub for updated ToR).

KH raised a point that in the FGB ToR it states that the FGB meeting and associated minutes are open to the public. EB queried how the federation should manage remote meetings and how this should be made public, whether a link should be shared with the members of the public and how this should be communicated.

BR advised there has not been a demand for members of the public to attend the meetings in the past. ST advised that minutes are usually made available on a request basis, confirming that most schools do not upload minutes onto the website. KH queried why, at the beginning of meetings, are the governing body reminded of confidentiality if the minutes are open to the public. It was agreed that CW would investigate and feedback to governors.

KH referred to the P&C ToR Paragraph 9 bii) which stated that the committee should review the progress of more able pupils. KH felt that whilst the committee reviewed how the federation addressed closing the gaps on less able pupils, there was not clear evidence of reviewing those more able.

BR advised that she had attended a conference, which referred to the types of terminology used to describe the ability of children, as this can create divides. BR recommended that the ToR could be changed to refer to reviewing all pupils and the progress of all groups of children, which would include specific educational needs, disadvantaged pupils and any other targeted groups that are being monitored. KH agreed that the terminology is important but also what actions are needed by governors. It was agreed that this would be put on the agenda for the next P&C meeting, 

Governors advised that the numbering on the ToR’s requires some adjustment - CW to update document and re-upload to Governor Hub.

EB advised that under the ToR for the Admission Committee it referred to Governors, however as NG is the chair and is an Associate Member this term was replaced with Governor members to enable NG to remain as chair and to be included within the required quorate of 3. (Following the meeting CW advised that NG cannot be included within the quorate, as Associate Members are not included for quorate calculations). | CW

Theologically rooted
Christian vision

A theologically-rooted Christian vision is one that finds its roots, its starting
place, in biblical and Christian teaching. Such a vision draws on the life and
teaching of Christ, and wider aspects of the bible and Christian thought, to
influence the ‘why’, ‘what’ and ‘how’ of school life in a way which
resonates/connects deeply with the needs of the community.

a) How is the school’s vision a clearly-articulated, theologically rooted Christian vision?
How does the trust’s vision resonate with this?
b) How do the specific needs of the school community inform the theologically rooted
Christian vision? In other words, do leaders understand the school’s context, and do
they know how to respond to it theologically?
c) Why have school leaders decided that the school should be a maintained school/an
academy? How does this status enhance the effectiveness of the school as a Church

How is the school’s vision a clearly-articulated, theologically rooted Christian vision?
How do the specific needs of the school community inform the theologically rooted Christian vision?

Summary
• There will be a firm expectation of a theologically rooted Christian
vision.
• There will be an enhanced freedom to be a Christian-vision-driven
Church school in the specific context of the school.
• Freedom also from an exhaustive one-size fits all set of criteria.
• Attention on the role of trust leaders in helping church schools flourish
